Many effects impose a condition, a temporary state that alters the recipient's capabilities. The following conditions are defined in the rules glossary ["Detailed Conditions"](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/glossary/condition_details) section:
- Blinded
- Charmed
- Deafened
- Exhaustion
- Frightened
- Grappled
- Incapacitated
- Invisible
- Paralyzed
- Petrified
- Poisoned
- Prone
- Restrained
- Stunned
- Unconscious

The definition of a condition specifies what happens to its recipient while affected by it, and some conditions apply other conditions.

### Duration
A condition lasts either for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition or until the condition is countered (the Prone condition is countered by standing up, for example).

### No Stacking
If multiple effects impose the same condition on you, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. Either you have a condition or you don't. The Exhaustion condition is an exception; its effects get worse if you have the condition and receive it again.
