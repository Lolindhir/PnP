An adventurer's standing within a particular faction or organization is tracked by renown. Renown increases or decreases depending on the actions of an adventurer. Benefits are tied to a character's renown, including ranks and titles within the organization and access to resources. 


### Tracking Renown

Renown is a numerical value that starts at 0, then increases or decreases as a character earns or loses favor and reputation within a particular faction or organization.
A player tracks renown separately for each organization his or her character is a member of. For example, an adventurer might have 5 renown within one faction and 20 renown within another, based on the character's interaction with each organization over the course of the campaign.

### Gaining or Losing Renown

A character earns renown by completing missions or quests that serve an organization's interests or involve the organization directly. Advancing an organization's interests increases a character's renown within that organization by 1. Completing a mission specifically assigned by that organization, or which directly benefits the organization, increases the character's renown by 2 instead.

On the other hand, a character loses renown acting against the interests of a faction or an organization.

For example, characters with connections to the noble Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon. Because the order likes to punish evildoers, you might increase each character's renown within the order by 1. Conversely, if killing the dragon was a mission given to the adventurers by a senior member of the order, completing the task might instead increase each character's renown by 2, showing the adventurers as effective allies. Meanwhile, the party's rogue might have looted a box of rare poisons from the dragon's hoard and sold it to a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You might increase the rogue's renown within the Zhentarim by 2 since this action directly increased that group's power and wealth, even though the task was not assigned by an agent of the Zhentarim.

Renown can only go up or down if news of an adventurer's actions could have reasonably been heard and believed by a significant portion of the faction or organization, at the DMâ€™s discretion. If in doubt, assume that it takes a week for news to spread, and that true news is always believed.
