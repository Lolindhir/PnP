## The Six Abilities

All creatures-characters and monsters-have six abilities that measure physical and mental characteristics, as shown on the Ability Descriptions table.

##### Ability Descriptions
| Ability      | Score Measures...                   |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Strength     | Physical might                      |
| Dexterity    | Agility, reflexes, and balance      |
| Constitution | Health and stamina                  |
| Intelligence | Reasoning and memory                |
| Wisdom       | Perceptiveness and mental fortitude |
| Charisma     | Confidence, poise, and charm        |

### Ability Scores
Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some monsters have a score as high as 30. The score represents the magnitude of an ability. The Ability Scores table summarizes what the scores mean.

##### Ability Scores
| Score | Meaning                                                                                                           |
| :---: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | This is the lowest a score can normally go. Ifa n effect reduces a score to 0, that effect explains what happens. |
|  2-9  | This represents a weak capability.                                                                                |
| 10-11 | This represents the human average.                                                                                |
| 12-19 | This represents a strong capability.                                                                              |
|  20   | This is the highest an adventurer's score can go unless a feature says otherwise.                                 |
| 21-29 | This represents an extraordinary capability.                                                                      |
|  30   | This is the highest a score can go.                                                                               |

### Ability Modifiers
Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever you make a D2O Test with that ability (explained in "D20 Tests"). An ability modifier is derived from its score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table.

##### Ability Modifiers
| Score | Modifier | ｜  | Score | Modifier |
| :---: | :------: | :-: | :---: | :------: |
|   1   |    -5    | ｜  | 16-17 |    +3    |
|  2-3  |    -4    | ｜  | 18-19 |    +4    |
|  4-5  |    -3    | ｜  | 20-21 |    +5    |
|  6-7  |    -2    | ｜  | 22-23 |    +6    |
|  8-9  |    -1    | ｜  | 24-25 |    +7    |
| 10-11 |    +0    | ｜  | 26-27 |    +8    |
| 12-13 |    +1    | ｜  | 28-29 |    +9    |
| 14-15 |    +2    | ｜  |  30   |   +10    |



## Proficiency

All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature's capabilities. A character's Proficiency Bonus increases as the character gains levels. A monster's Proficiency Bonus is based on its Challenge Rating. The Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is determined.
This bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or with an item that the creature uses to make the D20 Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.

##### Proficiency Bonus
| Level or CR | Bonus | ｜  | Level or CR | Bonus |
| :---------: | :---: | :-: | :---------: | :---: |
|   Up to 4   |  +2   | ｜  |    17-20    |  +6   |
|     5-8     |  +3   | ｜  |    21-24    |  +7   |
|    9-12     |  +4   | ｜  |    25-28    |  +8   |
|    13-16    |  +5   | ｜  |    29-30    |  +9   |

### The Bonus Doesn't Stack
Your Proficiency Bonus can't be added to a die roll or another number more than once. For example, if a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus if you're proficient in either skill, but you don't add it twice if you're proficient in both skills.
Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before being added. For example, the Expertise feature doubles the Proficiency Bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided only once.

### Skill Proficiencies
Most ability checks involve using a skill, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with an ability check. The descriptions of the actions you take specify which skill applies if you make an ability check for that action, and many other rules note when a skill is relevant. The DM has the ultimate say on whether a skill is relevant in a situation.
If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks involving that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, a creature can still make ability checks involving that skill but doesn't add its Proficiency Bonus. For example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the DM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character has Athletics proficiency, the character adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they make the check without adding their Proficiency Bonus.

#### Skill List
The skills are shown on the [Skills table](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/glossary/skills), which notes example uses for each skill proficiency as well as the ability check the skill most often applies to.

#### Determining Skills
A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in its stat block.

#### Skills with Different Abilities
Each skill proficiency is associated with an ability check. For example, the Intimidation skill is associated with Charisma. In some situations, the DM might allow you to apply your skill proficiency to a different ability check. For example, if a character tries to intimidate someone through a show of physical strength, the DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check rather than a Charisma (Intimidation) check. That character would make a Strength check and add their Proficiency Bonus if they have Intimidation proficiency.

### Saving Throw Proficiencies
Proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add their Proficiency Bonus to saves that use a particular ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom saves lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to your Wisdom saves. Some monsters also have saving throw proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks.
Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws, representing that class's training in evading or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example, are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves; they train to resist mental assault.

### Equipment Proficiencies
A character gains proficiency with various weapons and tools from their class and background. There are two categories of equipment proficiency:

**Weapons.** Anyone can wield a weapon, but proficiency makes you better at wielding it. If you have proficiency with a weapon, you add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls you make with it.
**Tools.** If you have proficiency with a tool, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have Proficiency in the skill that's also used with that check, you have Advantage on the check too. This means you can benefit from both skill proficiency and tool proficiency on the same ability check.
