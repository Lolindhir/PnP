## Damage Rolls
Each weapon, spell, and damaging monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage dice, add any modifiers, and deal the damage to your target. If there's a penalty to the damage, it's possible to deal 0 damage but not negative damage.
When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage roll. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. Unless a rule says otherwise, you don't add your ability modifier to a fixed damage amount that doesn't use a roll, such as the damage of a Blowgun. See the [Weapon section](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/equipment/weapons) for weapons' damage dice and the [Spellcasting section](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/general/spellcasting) for spells' damage dice.



## Critical Hits
When you score a Critical Hit, you deal extra damage. Roll all of the attack's damage dice, add them together, and then add the maximum possible value of all those dice plus any relevant modifiers as normal.
For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 1d4 for the damage, and add 4 (the maximum value of the 1d4) plus your relevant ability modifier.
If the attack involves additional damage dice, such as from the Rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you also add the maximum possible values of those dice.



## Saving Throws and Damage
Damage dealt via saving throws uses these rules.

### Damage Against Multiple Targets
When you create a damaging effect that forces two or more targets to make saving throws against it at the same time, roll the damage once for all the targets. For example, when a wizard casts Fireball, the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.

### Half Damage
Many saving throw effects deal half damage (round down) to a target when the target succeeds on the saving throw. The halved damage is equal to half the damage that would be dealt on a failed save.



## Damage Types
Each instance of damage has a type, like Fire or Slashing. Damage types are listed in the ["Damage Types" section](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/glossary/damage_types) of the glossary and have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as Resistance, rely on damage types.





## Resistance and Vulnerability
Some creatures and objects have Resistance or Vulnerability to certain damage types. If you have Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against you (round down). If you have Vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against you. For example, if you have Resistance to Cold damage, such damage is halved against you, and if you have Vulnerability to Fire damage, such damage is doubled against you.

### No Stacking
Multiple instances of Resistance or Vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if you have Resistance to Necrotic damage as well as Resistance to all damage, Necrotic damage is reduced by half against you.

### Order of Application
Modifiers to damage are applied in the following order: adjustments such as bonuses, penalties, or multipliers are applied first; Resistance is applied second; and Vulnerability is applied third. For example, a creature has Resistance to all damage and Vulnerability to Fire damage, and it's within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. If it takes 28 Fire damage, the damage is first reduced by 5 (to 23), then halved for the creature's Resistance (and rounded down to 11), then doubled for its Vulnerability (to 22).



## Immunity
Some creatures and objects have Immunity to certain damage types and conditions. Immunity to a damage type means you don't take damage of that type, and Immunity to a condition means you aren't affected by it.
