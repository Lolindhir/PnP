During their adventures, player characters meet many different people and face some monsters that would rather talk than fight. In those situations, it's time for social interaction, which takes many forms. For example, you might try to convince a burglar to confess to wrongdoing or try to flatter a guard. The Dungeon Master assumes the roles of any nonplayer characters who are participating.

Ability checks can be key in determining the outcome of a social interaction. Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC's attitude, but there might still be an element of chance if the DM wants dice to play a role in determining an NPC's response to you. In such situations, the DM will typically ask you to take the **Influence action**.

## Influence Action
With the Influence action, you urge a monster to do something. Describe or roleplay how you're communicating with the monster. Are you trying to deceive, intimidate, amuse, or gently persuade? The DM then determines whether the monster feels willing, unwilling, or hesitant due to your interaction; this determination establishes whether an ability check is necessary.

### Feeling
**Willing.** If your urging aligns with the monster's desires, no ability check is necessary; the monster fulfills your request in a way it prefers.
**Unwilling.** If your urging is repugnant to the monster or counter to its alignment, no ability check is necessary; it doesn't comply.
**Hesitant.** If you urge the monster to do something that it is hesitant to do, you must make an ability check, which is affected by the monster's attitude: Indifferent, Friendly, or Hostile. The Influence Checks table suggests which ability check to make based on how you're interacting with the monster. The DM chooses the check.

### Influence Check
| Ability Check            | Interaction                               |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Charisma (Deception)     | Deceiving a monster that understands you  |
| Charisma (Intimidation)  | Intimidating a monster                    |
| Charisma (Performance)   | Amusing a monster                         |
| Charisma (Persuasion)    | Persuading a monster that understands you |
| Wisdom (Animal Handling) | Gently coaxing a Beast or Monstrosity     |


### Attitude
An NPC's attitude toward your character is Friendly, Indifferent, or Hostile, as defined below. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help, and Hostile ones are inclined to hinder.

**Friendly.** A Friendly creature view you favorably. You have Advantage on an ability check to influence a Friendly creature.
**Indifferent.** An Indifferent creature has no desire to help or hinder you. Indifferent is the default attitude of a monster.
**Hostile.** A Hostile creature view you unfavorably. You have Disadvantage on an ability check to influence a Hostile creature.

### Haggling
* Selling price to players is the item's value.
* Buying price from players is half the value if it is used/damaged.
* Persuasion can be attempted (but it can also backfire!).
    * Advantage if proficient, e.g., due to background, familiarity with the merchant, knowledge of business practices, being part of the same guild/organization, etc.
    * Success: Price is increased (when selling) or decreased (when buying) by the rolled percentage value.
    * Failure: Price is decreased (when selling) or increased (when buying) by the rolled percentage value.
    * Percentage value depends on success, as you can see in the Haggling Percentage table.
    * Example: Item with a value of 1,000 SP and 10% rolled.
    On success, it can be bought for 90% (900 SP) or sold for 55% (650 SP).
    On failure, it can be bought for 110% (1,100 SP) or sold for 45% (450 SP).

##### Haggling Percentage
| +- from DC  | Percentage | Buying Cost | Selling Price* |
| :---------: | :--------: | :---------: | :------------: |
| 15 or more  |    50%     |     50%     |      150%      |
| 10 or more  |    30%     |     70%     |      130%      |
|  5 or more  |    20%     |     80%     |      120%      |
|  0 or more  |    10%     |     90%     |      110%      |
| less than 0 |     0%     |    100%     |      100%      |
| -5 or less  |    -10%    |    110%     |      90%       |
| -10 or less |    -20%    |    120%     |      80%       |
| -15 or less |    -30%    |    130%     |      70%       |

**remember: in most cases, the base selling price is half of an item's value*
