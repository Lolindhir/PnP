## Treating Wounds
A character can take 1 minute and spend one use of a healer’s kit to tend to a creature (can be itself) and restore 1d4 hit points. The creature can’t regain hit points from this "Treating Wounds" again until it finishes a Night Rest or starts a new Adventuring Period.
If the character is proficient in the Medicine skill, the creature regains additional hit points equal to the character’s proficiency bonus.
If the character also has the ‘Healer’ feat, they add double their proficiency bonus and the creature regains additional hit points equal to its maximum number of Hit Dice.

## Boost Natural Healing in Night Rest
During a Night rest, you can support the natural healing abilities of creatures using a pack of Herbal Medicine for each one who spends a Hit Die during this rest.

You can only do so, if you are proficient in the Medicine skill or with the herbalism kit. Make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check for each creature, if you are proficient with the herbalism kit you have advantage on the roll.
On a success, a creature can roll one additional Hit Dice which will not be removed from its current Hit Dice pool. A creature can do so only once per Night rest, regardless of how many Hit Dice it spends. 


## Tea Brewing
With one hour of work or as part of a Night rest, you can brew a tea that helps recover from the rigors of adventuring, provided you have the needed utensils and use one pack of Herbal Tea. 
Up to six creatures can drink from the tea and gain one of the following benefits, depending on the tea used, after finishing a Night rest (a creature can only benefit from one tea effect per Night rest):

- Morning Dew Tea (Morgentau): The creature removes one point of exhaustion.
- Salvatory Night Tea (Heilsame Nacht): If the number of the creature’s maximum Hit Dice is 10 or lower, it regains 1 spent Hit Die, else it regains 2 spent Hit Dice.
- Force of Nature Tea (Naturkraft): The creature can make a Saving Throw (Constitution) against one disease (or poison). If the creature can already make a Saving Throw, it has advantage on the throw instead.




## Cooking and Eating
With one hour of work or as part of a Night rest, you can prepare and serve a strengthening meal that helps creatures recover from the rigors of adventuring, provided you are proficient with cook's utensils and have them and suitable food, ingredients, and other supplies worth at least 2 SP for each partaking creature on hand. Each creature who eats from the meal regains one additional spent Hit Die at the end of the long rest, if it doesn’t already get this benefit from a comfortable or higher lifestyle or from another source (like drinking tea).

In addition, make a DC 15 Wisdom (Cook's utensils) check. On a success, those who partake of the meal gain the following benefits for 24 hours:
<div class="listNoGap"></div>

- The creature has advantage on Constitution saving throws against diseases.
- If the creature spends hit dice to heal, it regains one additional hit point per Hit Die spent.
