### Level 1: Expertise
You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Sleight of Hand and Stealth are recommended if you have proficiency in them.
At Rogue level 6, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

### Level 1: Sneak Attack
You know how to strike subtly and exploit your foes distraction. On your turn, every time you hit a creature with an attack you had advantage on the attack roll, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to that creature (only once per creature on the same turn). The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same as the weapon's type.
You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack table.

##### Sneak Attack Damage
| Rogue Level | Sneak Attack |
| :---------: | :----------: |
|      1      |     1d6      |
|      3      |     2d6      |
|      5      |     3d6      |
|      7      |     4d6      |
|      9      |     5d6      |
|     11      |     6d6      |
|     13      |     7d6      |
|     15      |     8d6      |
|     17      |     9d6      |
|     19      |     10d6     |


### Level 1: Thieves' Cant
You picked up various languages in the communities where you plied your roguish talents. You know Thieves' Cant and one other language of your choice, which you choose from the [Language Tables](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/glossary/languages).
Alternatively, you can forgo knowing Thieves' Cant and pick up another language of your choice.


### Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties ([Weapon Overview](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/equipment/weapons)) of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Daggers and Shortbows.
Whenever you start an Adventuring Period, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Shortswords.

### Level 2: Cunning Action
Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action:
- **Dash.** Gain extra movement equal to your speed for the current turn.
- **Disengage.** Your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.
- **Hide.** Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to attempt to hide.
- **Sleight of Hand.** Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to pick a lock or disarm a trap with Thieves' Tools or to pick a pocket.
- **Use an Object.** Take the utilize action, or take the Magic action to use a magic item that requires that action.

At 14th level, you gain a second Cunning Action each turn, but you can only use each option once per turn.


### Level 2: Second-Story Work
You've trained to get into especially hard-to-reach places, granting you these benefits.
**Climber.** You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.
**Jumper.** You can determine your jump distance using your Dexterity rather than your Strength.


### Level 3: Rogue Subclass
You gain a Rogue subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Rogue levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Rogue level or lower.
- [Arcane Trickster](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/rogue/arcane_trickster)
- [Assassin](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/rogue/assassin)
- [Soulknife](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/rogue/soulknife)


### Level 3: Steady Aim
As a Bonus Action, you give yourself Advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this feature only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.


### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain three feats (see the [Feat list](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/feats/Feat%2520list)) of your choice, for which you qualify. You have to take the [Ability Score Improvement](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/feats/Ability%2520Score%2520Improvement) feat at least once (two times is recommended).
You gain this feature again at Rogue levels 8, 10, 12, and 16.


### Level 5: Cunning Strike

You've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack.

**Cunning Strikes.** You learn four Cunning Strike effects of your choice from the [Cunning Strikes section](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/rogue/cunning_strikes). You can only learn effects once you reach the noted required Rogue level. You learn two additional Cunning Strikes of your choice at 11th and 17th level. Each time you reach a new Rogue level, you can also replace one Cunning Strike you know with a different one (regarding the required level).

**Cunning Strike Effects.** When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one Cunning Strike effect. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Distraction Pain effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack's damage before rolling.

**Saving Throws.** Some of your Cunning Strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the strike's effect. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

> Cunning Strike save DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Dexterity modifier


### Level 5: Uncanny Dodge
When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

### Level 6: Fast Assessment
With your Cunning Action, you can now also take the Evaluate or Search action.
Additionally, for every round in combat against a creature, you gain a +1 bonus to the check of the Evaluate or Search action targeting that creature.

### Level 7: Evasion
You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an *ice storm* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Level 7: Reliable Talent
Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike
**Double Strike.** You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost for each effect.
**Enhanced Strike.** If you use a Cunning Strike effect that forces the target to make a saving throw, you can reduce your Sneak Attack damage bonus by an additional number of d6s equal to the effects cost and force the target to make its saving throw with disadvantage.

### Level 14: Magic Item Expert
You've learned how to maximize use of magic items, granting you the following benefits
**Additional Attunement.** You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
**Free Charges.** Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.

### Level 14: Blindsense
Your senses have been honed to supernatural levels. If you can hear, you are aware of the location of any invisible or hidden creature within 10 feet of you.
The radius of Blindsense increases again when you reach 17th level (20 feet) and 20th level (30 feet) in this class.

### Level 15: Slippery Mind
You have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.

### Level 18: Elusive
You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll can have advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

### Level 18: Thief's Reflexes
You are adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal Initiative and your second turn at your Initiative minus 10.

### Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat or three other feats of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of the Night Spirit is recommended.

### Level 20: Stroke of Luck
You have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If you fail a D20 Test (Attack Roll, Ability Check, Saving Throw), you can turn the roll into a 20.
You can use this feature once per Adventuring Period. Also twice during that time, you can restore your use of it when you finish a Short Rest.
