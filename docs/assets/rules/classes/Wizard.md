### Level 1: Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells.
The complete rules for your spellcasting are explained in the [Wizard Spellcasting](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/wizard/wizard_spellcasting) section. As an overview, the key features of your spellcasting are listed below:

| Key Feature            | Characteristic              |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Spellcasting Ability   | Intelligence                |
| Spellcasting Focus     | Arcane Focus                |
| Free Cantrip           | [Prestidigitation](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Prestidigitation) |
| Cantrips               | Prepared (from Spellbook)   |
| Spells 1+              | Prepared (from Spellbook)   |
| Spell Slot Progression | Full Caster                 |
| Specialty              | Spellbook                   |



### Level 1: Ritual Adept
You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn't have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.



### Level 1: Arcane Recovery
You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you're a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels' worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.
You can use this feature once during an Adventuring Period.



### Level 2: Scholar
While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You have Expertise in the chosen skill.



### Level 3: Wizard Subclass
You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Wizard level or lower.

- [Diviner](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/wizard/diviner)
- [Evoker](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/wizard/evoker)
- [Illusionist](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/wizard/illusionist)



### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain three feats (see the [Feat list](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/feats/Feat%2520list)) of your choice, for which you qualify. You have to take the [Ability Score Improvement](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/feats/Ability%2520Score%2520Improvement) feat at least once (two times is recommended).
You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 8, 12, and 16.



### Level 5: Memorize Spell
Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of the Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting feature with another spell from the book.



### Level 18: Spell Mastery
You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.
Whenever you start an Adventuring Period, you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.



### Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat or three other feats of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.



### Level 20: Signature Spells
Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once per Adventuring Day at level 3 without expending a spell slot. Also twice during that time, you can restore your free casting of them when you finish a Short Rest.
To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.
