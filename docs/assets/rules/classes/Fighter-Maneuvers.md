**At Higher Levels.** Some of the maneuvers in this section let you roll Superiority Dice for damage or hit points. If a Superiority Die roll lets you add to a damage roll, reduce incoming damage, or gain temporary hit points, you can roll additional dice. For each Superiority Die you roll, you add additional dice depending on your Character level as shown in the table below. These additional dice cannot inflict critical damage or trigger other effects or abilities.

| :---: | :-------------: |
