## Silver Standard

Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the copper piece (CP), the silver piece (SP), and the gold piece (GP). The platinum piece (PP) is extremely rare and worth a fortune.

The silver piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of silver pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the silver piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in silver bars, gold or platinum coins, letters of credit, or valuable goods.

With one silver piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one silver piece a day.
One silver piece is worth one hundred copper pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. Ten copper pieces buy a laborer's work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.

## Weight

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.
