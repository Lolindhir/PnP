### Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor
If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

### Shield
You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it.

**Special Reaction.** If you are hit by an attack roll and you have a shield with an armor bonus greater than 1 donned, you can use your reaction to turn the hit into a miss by interposing the shield. If you do so, the shield gets damaged and looses one on its armor class bonus.

The cost to repair a shield depends on the armor class bonus you want to restore as you can see in the Shield Repair table below.


##### Shield Repair Table
| Bonus to Restore to |      Cost |
| :-----------------: | --------: |
|         +2          |      5 gp |
|         +3          |    250 gp |
|         +4          |  2.500 gp |

**special costs for masterwork shields*

### Strength
Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows "Str 13" or "Str 15" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.



### Getting Into and Out of Armor

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.
***Don***. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.
***Doff***. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

| Category     | Don        | Doff      |
| :----------- | :--------- | :-------- |
| Light Armor  | 1 minute   | 1 minute  |
| Medium Armor | 5 minutes  | 1 minute  |
| Heavy Armor  | 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Shield       | 1 Action   | 1 Action  |
