### Level 1: Fighting Style
You have honed your martial prowess and gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see Feats table). Defense is recommended.
Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting Style feat.


### Level 1: Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a Bonus Action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 plus your Fighter level.
You can use this feature twice per Adventuring Period. Also twice during that time, you can recover one expended use when you finish a Short Rest.
When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature: 3 at 4th level and 4 at 10th level.


### Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property ([Weapon Overview](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/equipment/weapons)) of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you start an Adventuring Period, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose.
When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain the ability to use the Mastery properties of more kinds of weapons: 4 at 4th level, 5 at 10th level, and 6 at 16th level.


### Level 2: Combat Superiority
Your experience on the battlefield has refined your fighting techniques. You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called Superiority Dice.

**Maneuvers.** You learn two maneuvers of your choice from the [Maneuvers section](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/fighter/maneuvers). Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.
You learn an additional maneuver at certain Fighter levels as shown in the table below. Each time you gain a new Fighter level, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

| Level | Maneuvers |
| :---: | :-------: |
|   2   |     3     |
|   5   |     4     |
|   8   |     5     |
|  11   |     6     |
|  14   |     7     |
|  17   |     8     |

**Superiority Dice.** Per Adventuring Period, you have two Superiority Dice, which are d6s. You gain additional Superiority Dice for that time when you reach certain Fighter levels as shown in the table below.
A Superiority Die is expended when you use it. Twice during an Adventuring Period, you can recover all expended Superiority Dice when you finish a Short Rest.

| Fighter Level | Number of Dice |
| :-----------: | :------------: |
|       1       |       -        |
|       2       |       2        |
|       4       |       3        |
|       8       |       4        |
|      12       |       5        |
|      16       |       6        |

**Saving Throws.** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

> Maneuver save DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)


### Level 2: Tactical Mind
Your are trained to excel on and off the battlefield. When you make an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself towards success. Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll 1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check.
If it's a check the DM will tell you the outcome of, you can do this after you know that you failed the check. If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn't expended.


### Level 3: Fighter Subclass
You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Fighter levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Fighter level or lower.
- [Champion](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/fighter/champion)
- [Eldritch Knight](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/fighter/eldritch_knight)

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain three feats (see the [Feat list](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/feats/Feat%2520list)) of your choice, for which you qualify. You have to take the [Ability Score Improvement](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/feats/Ability%2520Score%2520Improvement) feat at least once (two times is recommended).
You gain this feature again at Fighter levels 6, 8, 12, 14, and 16.


### Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


### Level 5: Action Surge
You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the Magic action.
You can use this feature once per Adventuring Period. Also twice during that time, you can recover all expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.
At 20th level, you can use it twice per Adventuring Period, but only once on the same turn.


### Level 5: Tactical Shift
Whenever you activate your Second Wind with a Bonus Action, you can move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.


### Level 5: Martial Combat Superiority
Your Superiority Die becomes a d8.


### Level 9: Indomitable

Per Adventuring Period, you can use this feature once, twice starting at level 13, and three times starting at level 17.


### Level 9: Tactical Master
When you attack with a weapon whose mastery property you can use, you can replace that property with the Push, Sap, or Slow property for that attack.

### Level 11: Improved Combat Superiority

### Level 13: Studied Attacks
You study your opponents and learn from each attack you make. If you make an attack roll against a creature and miss, you have Advantage on your next roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.


### Level 17: Three Extra Attacks
You can attack four times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


### Level 17: Ultimate Combat Superiority
