## Aspect of Air
Wind whirls around you, enhancing your mobility on the battlefield.
* You have resistance against lightning damage and damage caused by harmful fog, smoke or other gases. You also have advantage on saving throws against the harmful effects of such gases.
* Ranged weapon attacks made against you have disadvantage on the attack roll.
* When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to succeed on that saving throw instead.
* You can take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action.
* You gain advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks related to jumping and once on each of your turns, you can jump up to 30 feet by spending 10 feet of movement.
* Your Speed increases by 10 feet. If you reached at least 8th Shaman level, you can Hover and gain a Fly Speed of 10 feet. At 13th level, the Fly Speed is 30. At 17th level, the Fly Speed is 60 feet.
* **Dazing Booms.** With an action, you compress and redirect the air surrounding you to attack close enemies with thunderous booms audible out to 300 feet. When you expend a spell slot of 1st level, target any number of creature within 5 feet of you. Make a melee attack (weapon or spell) against each target. On a hit, a target takes 2d8 thunder damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't take a reaction until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action. It gets only one of the three.
Higher Slot Levels: When you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the range of this effect is increased by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 1st.



## Aspect of Earth
Bits of rock spread across your body, strengthening your melee and defensive capabilities.
* You gain temporary hit points equal to 3 times your Shaman level until you dismiss or drop the earth aspect.
* You gain a +1 bonus to your AC. The bonus increases at Shaman levels 7 (+2), 14 (+3), and 20 (+4). 
* You can't cast spells, but calling the Earth Aspect doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *Call Lightning*, that you've already cast. When you reach 20th Shaman level, this restriction no longer applies to you.
* For the evaluation of the Concentration Check DC to hold concentration after taking damage, the damage is additionally halved for you.
* You can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes. Also they do double damage to objects and structures. Additionally, you can roll a d8 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. This die changes when you reach 5th Shaman level (d10), 11th Shaman level (d12), and 17th Shaman level (2d6).
* If you attacked this turn with an unarmed strike or your Rock Smash, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
* **Rock Smash.** As an action, you can expend a spell slot to focus the rock surrounding you at your fist or weapon and make a mighty blow. When you expend a spell slot of 1st level, make a melee attack (weapon or spell) against one creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 2d12 bludgeoning damage and must make a Strength saving throw. You can add your Strength modifier to saving throw DC. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. A huge creature has advantage and a gargantuan creature automatically succeeds on the save.
Higher Slot Levels: When you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each spell slot level above 1st.



## Aspect of Fire
Flames race across your body, allowing you constant, empowered ranged attacks.
* You have resistance against cold damage.
* You shed bright light out to 10 feet and dim light for an additional 10 feet. 
* Any creature within 5 feet of you that hits you with a melee attack takes fire damage equal to half your Shaman level. The target of your Fire Aspects *Hellish Rebuke* spell also takes this additional damage. 
* **Flaming Beam.** You can use an action to hurl a fire beam at a creature or object within 120 feet. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by the beam ignites if it isn't being worn or carried. You can hurl more beams when you reach higher Shaman levels: two beams at 5th Shaman level, three beams at 11th Shaman level, and four beams at 17th Shaman level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.
* **Flaming Rays.** Alternatively, you can use an action and expend a spell slot to hurl more powerful fire rays. When you expend a spell slot of 1st level, hurl two fire rays at targets within 120 feet. You can hurl them at one target or several. Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage.
Higher Slot Levels: When you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 1st.



## Aspect of Water
Water flows around your body, serving as catalyst to help healing wounds taken in battle.
* You have resistance against fire and acid damage.
* You have a swimming speed of 40 feet and can breathe underwater.
* You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to prevent and escape from being grappled.
* At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to a fifth of your Shaman level (rounded up).
* **Healing Flow.** As an action, you can expend a spell slot to channel the regenerating properties of water and heal a creature you touch. When you expend a spell slot of 1st level, the creature regains a number of hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
Higher Slot Levels: When you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 3d8 for each spell slot level above 1st.
