## Spellcasting 

**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

**Free Cantrip.** You know the *[Prestidigitation](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Prestidigitation)* cantrip and have it always prepared. It doesn't count against the number of Wizard cantrips you can prepare.

**Spellbook.** Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify. You determine the book's appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.
The book contains the spells you know. It starts with five Wizard cantrips and six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice.

**Adding additional Spells to the Book.** Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two level 1+ Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Available Spell Slots table above. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.

**Copying a Spell into the Book.** When you find a Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it's of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. A cantrip takes 1 hour and costs 20 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.

**Copying the Book.** You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell (30 minutes and 5 GP for a cantrip).
If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many Wizards keep a backup spellbook.

**Spell Slots.** The Available Spell Slots table above shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells.
You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Cantrips.** You prepare three cantrips from your spellbook to cast with this feature.
When you reach Wizard level 4, the number of prepared cantrips increases to four. When you reach Wizard level 10, the number of prepared cantrips increases to five.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the the Prepared Spells table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from your spellbook until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, choosen from your spellbook.
If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.
If you are using the Gritty Realism variant, you can change your list whenever you finish a Night Rest, but spells with currently active effects have to remain prepared.
