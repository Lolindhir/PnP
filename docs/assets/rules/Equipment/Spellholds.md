A Spellhold bears the magic of a single spell determined by the scroll's creator.
There are different types of Spellholds depending on their source of magic and the spell list the spell is from as listed in the Spellhold Types table below.

##### Spellhold Types
| Type         | Spell Origin | Proficiency | Spell List                      |
| :----------- | :----------- | :---------- | :------------------------------ |
| Spell Scroll | Arcane Weave | Arcana      | Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard |
| Prayer Bead  | Divine Power | Religion    | Cleric, Paladin                 |
| Nature Stone | Primal Force | Nature      | Druid, Ranger, Shaman           |






**Using a Spellhold.** Spellholds are usable by anyone with proficiency in its corresponding skill as described in the Spellhold Types table. If you are proficient, you can use a Magic action and make an Spellhold check to try to release its magic.

> **Spellhold Check** = Intelligence (Arcana/Religion/Nature) Check

> **Spellhold Check DC** = 10 + spell level

**Successful Check.** On a success, you cast the Spellhold's spell with an Attack Bonus and Saving Throw DC depending on the spell's level (see below) and without having to provide any of the spell's components. The Spellhold disintegrates when the casting is completed and its magic is released.

##### Spellhold Attacks and Saving Throw DCs
| Spell Level | Attack Bonus | Save DC |
| :---------: | :----------: | :-----: |
|   Cantrip   |      +5      |   13    |
|     1st     |      +5      |   13    |
|     2nd     |      +5      |   13    |
|     3rd     |      +7      |   15    |
|     4th     |      +7      |   15    |
|     5th     |      +9      |   17    |
|     6th     |      +9      |   17    |
|     7th     |     +10      |   18    |
|     8th     |     +10      |   18    |
|     9th     |     +11      |   19    |


**Failed Check.** On a failure, you can't release the spell but the Spellhold doesn't disintegrate.

**Only Spells with Casting Time of Action or Bonus Action.** Using a Spellhold is always a Magic action. Therefore, a Spellhold can only contain spells with a casting time of an action or a bonus action. If the casting time is a bonus action, using the Spellhold still requires an action.
