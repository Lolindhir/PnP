## Elf

***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar.

***Extra Language***. You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.

***Sea Cunning.***

## Halflings

***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn't secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others.

Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.
