Your character's background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative before your character embarked on a life of adventure.



### Parts of a Background
A background includes the following parts:

**Background Feature.** Each background provides a unique feature that represents a special ability or benefit your character gains from their background. This feature can offer various advantages, such as special knowledge, connections, or abilities that can be used during your adventures.

**Starting Feat.** A background gives your character a starting feat, which grants your character particular capabilities.

**Skill Proficiencies.** A background gives your character proficiency in two specified skills.

**Tool Proficiencies.** Most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools are detailed in the [Tools section](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/equipment/tools).

**Languages.** Each background gives you a number of languages you understand and can speak. Languages are detailed in the [Languages Glossary entry](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/glossary/languages).



### Sample Background
If you choose any of the pre made backgrounds detailed in the [Sample Backgrounds section](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/creation/character_creation/backgrounds/backgrounds_samples), you gain all its described benefits.
If your character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill, tool, or other) instead.



### Custom Background
You might want to create your own background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To create a customized background:
