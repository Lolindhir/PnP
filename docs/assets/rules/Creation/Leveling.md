**Story-Based Advancement.** Rather than gaining a level after a certain number of sessions, your advancement is tied to accomplishing particular goals in the campaign. When you achieve those goals, you level up.

**Gaining a Level.** When you gain a level, follow these steps:

1. **Choose a Class.** Most characters advance in the same class. However, you might decide to gain a level in another class using the rules in the [Multiclassing section](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/creation/multiclassing).

2. **Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice.** Each time you gain a level, you gain an additional Hit Die. Roll a d6 for your hit points. If you roll a 1, you can reroll once. Depending on your character class, the difference to the actual hit die is then added. This results in the following determination of Hit Point maximum increase for each class:

##### Hit Point Increase by Class
| Class                                             |    HP at Level-Up |
| :------------------------------------------------ | ----------------: |
| Barbarian                                         | 1d6 + CON mod + 6 |
| Fighter, Paladin, Ranger                          | 1d6 + CON mod + 4 |
| Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, Shaman, Warlock | 1d6 + CON mod + 2 |
| Sorcerer, Wizard                                  |     1d6 + CON mod |

3. **Record New Class Features.** Look at your class features, and note the features you gain at your new level in that class. Make any choices offered by a new feature.

4. **Adjust Proficiency Bonus.** A character's Proficiency Bonus increases at certain levels, as shown in the [Character Advancement table](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/creation/leveling/leveling_advancement) and your class features table. When your Proficiency Bonus increases, increase all the numbers on your character sheet that include your Proficiency Bonus.

5. **Adjust Ability Modifiers.** If you choose the Ability Score Improvement feat, your ability modifier also changes if the new score is an even number. When that happens, adjust all the numbers on your character sheet that use that ability modifier. When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your Hit Point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if a character reaches level 8 and increases their Constitution score from 17 to 18, the Constitution modifier increases to +4. The character's Hit Point maximum then increases by 8, in addition to the Hit Points gained for reaching level 8.

**Bonus Feats at Level 20.** A DM can use feats as a form of advancement after characters reach level 20 to provide greater power to characters who have no more levels to gain. With this approach, each character gains one feat of their choice for every level up the character gains above 20th level. Epic Boon feats are especially appropriate for these bonus feats, but a player can choose any feat for which their level 20 character qualifies.
