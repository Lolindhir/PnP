**Starting at a Higher Level.** Your DM might start you at a higher level. If you start at level 3 or higher, write your chosen subclass on your character sheet. See the "Starting at Higher Levels" section later in the chapter for more information.

**Proficiency Bonus.** The features table in your class description shows your Proficiency Bonus (described in chapter 1), which is +2 for a level 1 character.
