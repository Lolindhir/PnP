Here are the steps to make a character:
<div class="listNoGap"></div>

1. **Choose a Race**
2. **Choose a Class**
3. **Choose a Background**
4. **Determine Ability Scores**
5. **Choose Intelligence Bonuses**
6. **Determine Mechanical Details**
7. **Describe your Character**
8. **Choose Equipment**



## Step 1: Choose a Race
Choose a race for your character. The available races are summarized in the [Race Overview table](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/races/race_list). See the [Race section](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/races) for the races' details. 
Your chosen race influences step 4, when you determine your character's ability scores, and determines your character's size and Speed. Additionally, it gives you special traits.



## Step 2: Choose a Class
Choose a class for your character. The available classes are summarized in the [Class Overview table](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/class_list). See the [Class section](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes) for the classes' details. 
You gain all the traits in the class' Core Traits table and the class' level 1 features.



## Step 3: Choose a Background
Choose your character's background. You can choose any of the sample backgrounds detailed in the [Background section](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/creation/backgrounds) or create a custom background for yourself.
A background provides concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, languages, and feats).

**Background Feature.** Each background provides a unique feature that represents a special ability or benefit your character gains from their background. This feature can offer various advantages, such as special knowledge, connections, or abilities that can be used during your adventures.

**Proficiencies.** Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills. In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools.

**Languages.** Each background gives you a number of languages you understand and can speak.

**Feat.** A background gives you a feat, which grants your character particular capabilities.



## Step 4: Determine Ability Scores

### Choose an Ability Score Combination
To determine your ability scores, you will use a defined array of ability scores. These scores can then be freely assigned to the six abilities. You can choose from the following five combinations:

> 15  15  13  10  10  8
> 15  14  14  10  10  8
> 15  14  13  12  10  8
> 14  14  14  12  10  8
> 14  14  13  12  12  8



### Adjust Ability Score
After assigning your ability scores, adjust them according to your race and possibly your background. 
*Constraint: After adjusting, no ability score can exceed a value of 17.*

**Adjustment based on your Race.** Increase one score of you choice by 2 and a different one by 1. The +2 must be applied to one of the main abilities of your race, while the +1 can be applied to any ability score. Alternatively, you can increase three scores by 1 (at least one of those scores must be a main ability score of your race).

**Racial Bonus.** Some races give a bonus to an ability score. Apply this bonus.

**Background Feat Adjustment.** Your background allows you to gain a feat. If you choose the Ability Score Increase feat, apply the chosen ability's bonus.

### Determine Ability Modifiers
Finally, determine your ability modifiers using the [Ability Modifiers table](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/glossary/ability_modifiers).



## Step 5: Choose Intelligence Bonuses
For positive Intelligence modifiers, you receive points that you can spend on additional proficiencies or languages when creating your character. For example, if you have an Intelligence score of 15, you have a modifier of +2 and would receive 2 points to invest. The table below shows all the bonuses you can spend your points on.

##### Intelligence Bonuses table
| Cost | Bonus                                                                          |
| :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | Knowledge Skill (Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion) *(only available once)* |
|  1   | Tool Proficiency                                                               |
|  1   | Standard Language                                                              |
|  2   | Rare Language                                                                  |
|  2   | Class Skill (Skills available through class)                                   |
|  2   | Expertise in Knowledge Skill                                                   |
|  3   | Skill (any)                                                                    |



## Step 6: Determine Mechanical Details


**Proficiency Bonus.** The features table in your class description shows your Proficiency Bonus (described in chapter 1), which is +2 for a level 1 character.

**Saving Throws.** For the saving throws you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the appropriate ability modifier and note the total. Some players also like to note the modifier for saving throws they're not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.

**Skills.** For skills you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated with that skill, and note the total. You might also wish to note the modifier for skills you're not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.

**Passive Perception.** Sometimes your DM will determine whether your character notices something without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check; the DM uses your Passive Perception instead. Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general awareness of your surroundings when you're not actively looking for something. Use this formula to determine your Passive Perception score:
Passive Perception = 10 + Wisdom (Perception) check modifier
Include all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom (Perception) checks. For example, if your character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Perception skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 for your Wisdom modifier + 2 for proficiency).

**Hit Points.** Your class and Constitution modifier determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1, as shown on the Level 1 Hit Points by Class table.

#### Level 1 Hit Points by Class
| Class                          | Hit Point Maximum            |
| :----------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| Barbarian                      | 12 + Con. modifier           |
| Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger    | 10 + Con. modifier           |
| Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, or Warlock | 8 + Con. modifier |
| Sorcerer or Wizard             | 6 + Con. modifier            |

The character sheet includes room to note your current Hit Points when you take damage, as well as any Temporary Hit Points you might gain. There's also space to track Death Saving Throws.

**Hit Point Dice.** Your class's description tells you the die type of your character's Hit Point Dice (or Hit Dice for short); write this on your character sheet. At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to recover Hit Points. Your character sheet also includes space to note how many Hit Dice you've spent.

**Initiative.** Write your Dexterity modifier in the space for Initiative on your character sheet.

**Armor Class.** Without armor or a shield, your base Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If your starting equipment includes armor or a shield (or both), calculate your AC using the rules in chapter 6. A class feature might give you a different way to calculate your AC.

**Attacks.** In the Weapons & Damage Cantrips section of the character sheet, write your starting weapons. The attack roll bonus for a weapon with which you have proficiency is one of the following unless a weapon's property says otherwise:
- Melee attack bonus: Strength modifier + Proficiency Bonus
- Ranged attack bonus: Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus

Look up the damage and properties of your weapons in chapter 6. You add the same ability modifier you use for attacks with a weapon to your damage rolls with that weapon.

**Spellcasting.** Note both the saving throw DC for your spells and the attack bonus for attacks you make with them, using these formulas:
- Spell save DC = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus
- Spell attack bonus = spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus

Your spellcasting ability modifier for a spell is determined by whatever feature gives you the ability to cast the spell.

**Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells.** If your class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, your class features table shows the number of spell slots you have available, how many cantrips you know, and how many spells you can prepare. Choose your cantrips and prepared spells, and note them—along with your number of spell slots—on your character sheet.



## Step 7: Describe your Character

### Considering Your Past and Present
Let your character's background and species inspire how you imagine their past. That past fed into the character's present. With that in mind, consider answers to the following questions as your character:

- Who raised you?
- Who was your dearest childhood friend?
- Did you grow up with a pet?
- Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?
- Did you join an organization, such as a guild or religion? If so, are you still a member of it?
- What elements of your past inspire you to go on adventures now?



### Step 4: Choose an Alignment
Choose your character's alignment from the options below, and note it on your character sheet. D&D assumes that player characters aren't of an evil alignment. Check with your DM before making an evil character.

#### The Nine Alignments
A creature's alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). The summaries of the alignments below describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment; individuals can vary from that behavior.

**Lawful Good (LG).** Lawful Good creatures endeavor to do the right thing as expected by society. Someone who fights injustice and protects the innocent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.

**Neutral Good (NG).** Neutral Good creatures do the best they can, working within rules but not feeling bound by them. A kindly person who helps others according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.

**Chaotic Good (CG).** Chaotic Good creatures act as their conscience directs with little regard for what others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron's tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the poor is probably Chaotic Good.

**Lawful Neutral (LN).** Lawful Neutral individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of life—and isn't swayed either by the demands of those in need or by the temptations of evil—is probably Lawful Neutral.

**Neutral (N).** Neutral is the alignment of those who prefer to avoid moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Someone who's bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.

**Chaotic Neutral (CN).** Chaotic Neutral creatures follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.

**Lawful Evil (LE).** Lawful Evil creatures methodically take what they want within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploiting citizens while scheming for power is probably Lawful Evil.

**Neutral Evil (NE).** Neutral Evil is the alignment of those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.

**Chaotic Evil (CE).** Chaotic Evil creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or bloodlust. A villain pursuing schemes of vengeance and havoc is probably Chaotic Evil.


### Alignment and Personality
Alignment can shape a character's personality, goals, and core beliefs. Looking at the two elements of an alignment, you can use the lists below to inspire details of your character's personality.

### Personality Traits by Alignment
| Alignment | d4 | Associated Trait |
| :-------: | :-: | :--------------: |
| Chaotic   |  1  | Boastful         |
|           |  2  | Impulsive        |
|           |  3  | Rebellious       |
|           |  4  | Self-absorbed    |
| Good      |  1  | Compassionate    |
|           |  2  | Helpful          |
|           |  3  | Honest           |
|           |  4  | Kind             |
| Evil      |  1  | Dishonest        |
|           |  2  | Vengeful         |
|           |  3  | Cruel            |
|           |  4  | Greedy           |
| Lawful    |  1  | Cooperative      |
|           |  2  | Loyal            |
|           |  3  | Judgmental       |
|           |  4  | Methodical       |
| Neutral   |  1  | Selfish          |
|           |  2  | Disinterested    |
|           |  3  | Laconic          |
|           |  4  | Pragmatic        |




## Step 8: Choose Equipment

Starting Gold and look up







## 4. Beschreibung des Charakters
Es wird eine etwas abgewandelte Form des Inspirationssystems verwendet, welches im Verzeichnis zur Charaktererstellung erläutert wird. Dort findet sich auch eine Erklärung und Hilfestellung für die Vergabe von Alignment und Persönlichen Eigenschaften.
Als Background darf jeder bisher offiziell Veröffentlichte (Übersicht im Verzeichnis) verwendet werden. Dabei muss sich, wie auch im Player’s Handbook als Möglichkeit angegeben, nicht stur an die Beschreibung gehalten werden, sondern Proficiencies, Sprachen, Features etc. können flexibel getauscht und vergeben werden. Auch wenn ihr eine Idee oder eine Vorstellung für einen neuen Background oder ein neues Background-Feature habt, dann können wir das gerne besprechen und einbauen.


## 5. Ausrüstung
Bei der Erstellung eines Level 1 Charakters werden die gleichen Regeln verwendet, die im Player’s Handbook beschrieben sind (entweder Verwendung des Starting Equipments oder Kauf mit einem Klassen-abhängigen Budgets). Ein neuer Charakter auf höherem Level hat aber in seiner Vergangenheit potentiell schon mehr Geld und auch Ausrüstung angesammelt. Je nach Höhe des Levels werde ich euch deshalb ein bestimmtes Budget und ggfs. auch schon eine Auswahl aus magischen Gegenständen geben. Dies ist aber unteranderem abhängig vom bisherigen Verlauf der Kampagne und deshalb kann ich hier noch keine konkreten Angaben für jedes Level machen. Eine Liste mit dem Startgeld, die insbesondere bei One-Shots eingesetzt werden kann, findet sich im Verzeichnis zur Charaktererstellung.
