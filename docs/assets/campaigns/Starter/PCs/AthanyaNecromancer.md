The Path of the Necromancer is a journey of personal growth and mastery, structured as a progression through 12 steps. At each step, you may choose a new training goal, allowing you to forge your own unique path by selecting features from three distinct cults: the Cult of Life Manipulation, the Cult of Necrotic Power, and the Cult of Undead Control.

### The Three Cults

**Cult of Life Manipulation.** This cult focuses on harnessing and manipulating the vital energies of living creatures. Its practitioners master the art of reaping life force from the dying, healing themselves and others, and even transferring life energy between creatures. Their magic is rooted in the balance between death and restoration, allowing them to walk the line between harm and healing.

**Cult of Necrotic Power.** Devotees of this cult embrace the destructive and corrupting aspects of necromancy. They sacrifice their own life force to empower their spells, inflicting devastating necrotic damage on their foes. Through pain and sacrifice, they unlock greater magical potency, specializing in overwhelming force and the manipulation of death energy to enhance their offensive capabilities.

**Cult of Undead Control.** This cult is dedicated to the mastery and command of undead creatures. Its members excel at animating corpses, enhancing their undead minions, and exerting control over even the most willful undead. Their path is one of domination and utility, transforming the dead into loyal servants and unleashing their full potential in battle and beyond.

### Features, Tiers and Prerequisites

Each cult offers a series of features, organized into four tiers (Tier 1 to Tier 4), representing increasing power and specialization. To select a feature from a given tier within a cult, you must have already acquired at least one feature from each previous tier of that cult. For example, to take a Tier 3 feature from the Cult of Necrotic Power, you must already possess at least the Tier 1 and one Tier 2 feature from that cult. This ensures a logical progression and deepening of your chosen magical discipline.

In addition to the cult-specific features, there are powerful combination features. These require you to have at least one Tier 2 feature from each of the involved cults, reflecting your broad expertise and ability to blend different necromantic arts.

### Training and Higher Tier Mentorship

Advancement along the path is not only a matter of choice but also of training and mentorship:
- To gain your Base abilities and your first Tier 1 feature, you must study from the Grimoire of a Red Wizard.
- To unlock a Tier 2 feature, you must seek out and train with any Red Wizard.
- Tier 3 features and combination features require guidance from a specific Red Wizard who is a member of the cult associated with the feature.
- Achieving a Tier 4 feature demands tutelage from a true master of the cult.

*choose your own path, starting at the base*



## Base Features

### Necromancy Scribe
The gold and time you must spend to copy an necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.
Additionally, you can add spells available to the Necromancy Wizard Subclass to your spell book, even if they are no Wizard spells. For you, they count as Wizard spells.

### Necromancy Spells
You know the cantrips *[Chill Touch](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Chill%2520Touch)*, *[Spare the Dying](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Spare%2520the%2520Dying)*, and *[Toll the Dead](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Toll%2520the%2520Dead)* and the spell *[Animate Dead](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Animate%2520Dead)*. You have them always prepared and they don't count against the number of cantrips and spells you can prepare.




## Cult of Life Manipulation Features

### Tier 1 - Grim Harvest
**Life at Death.** Once per turn, when you kill one or more enemies with a Wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell's level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy.
**Grim Marking.** When you hit an enemy with a spell of 1st level or higher but do not kill him, you can mark that enemy. Only one enemy can be marked at a time; marking a new enemy removes the mark from the previous one. If the marked enemy dies, you can use your reaction to regain hit points as if you had killed him with your Grim Harvest.

### Tier 2 - Jolt to Life
When you cast [Spare the Dying](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Spare%2520the%2520Dying), you can modify the spell so that it sends a jolt of necrotic energy through the target, reviving it. The target regains 1 Hit Point, and each creature in a 10-foot Emanation originating from the target makes a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking Necrotic damage equal to 1d4 plus half your Wizard level (round up) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
You can modify the spell this way a number of times equal to half your Proficiency bonus (round up), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Tier 2 - Transfer Life Force
You sacrifice some of your health to mend another creature's injuries. Using an action, roll a number of d6 up to half your Wizard level (round up), you take necrotic damage equal to the total number rolled, which can't be reduced in any way, and one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet regains a number of hit points equal to the total number rolled. 
You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your Proficiency bonus (round up), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Tier 3 - Keeper of Souls
**Transfer Life.** When you would regain hit points through your Grim Harvest feature, you can instead choose another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself to regain the hit points instead.
**Enhanced Harvest.** Additionally, you can increase the amount of hit points healed by your Grim Harvest feature by three times your Wizard level. Once you increase the healing in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

### Tier 4 - Overflow
If you restore hit points to a creature with a Necromancer's Path feature and heal more than the creature's maximum hit points, the creature gains an amount of temporary hit points equal to the exceeding amount of healed hit points.





## Cult of Necrotic Power Features

### Tier 1 - Pull of Death
When you deal damage to a Bloodied creature with a Wizard spell, that creature takes an extra 1d4 + the spell's level Necrotic damage.

### Tier 2 - Life to Damage
Immediately after damaging a creature with a Wizard spell that targets only one creature, you can use a bonus action to deal additional damage with the spell by using your own life force.
Roll 1d6. Inflict the rolled amount as necrotic damage to yourself. This damage can’t be taken on temporary hit points and ignores damage resistance and immunity. Your spell deals additional necrotic damage equal to twice the rolled amount.
You can even enhance the damage further by expending available Hit Dice up to your Proficiency Bonus. For each expended Hit Die, you roll an additional d6.

### Tier 2 - Enhancement through Sacrifice
You can use a Bonus Action to take 1d6 Necrotic damage. This damage can’t be taken on temporary hit points and ignores damage resistance and immunity. Until the end of you turn, you have Advantage on the attack rolls of Wizard spells you cast.
As part of this Bonus Action, you can expend a number of Hit Dice up to half your Proficiency Bonus. For every Hit Die expended, you gain a +2 Bonus to the attack rolls and a +1 Bonus to your spell save DC of Wizard spells you cast.

### Tier 3 - Twinned Death
When you cast a Wizard spell of level 5 or lower from the Necromancy school that targets one creature, you can target a second creature within the spell's range. If the spell requires costly or consumed Material components, you must provide Material components for each target.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

### Tier 4 - Overwhelming Power
**Exploding Dice.** All dice of your Necromancer's Path features become exploding dice (if such a die rolls it's maximum number, roll it again and add both rolls together).
**Enhanced Critical.** Additionally, your attack rolls of Wizard spells you cast can score a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. Spells from the Necromancy School even score a Critical Hit on a roll of 17-20 on the d20.






## Cult of Undead Control Features

### Tier 1 - Enhanced Animation
**Action Cast.** You can cast *[Animate Dead](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Animate%2520Dead)* with a casting time of an Action instead of its regular casting time.
**Enhancement.** In addition, you can enhance the corpse with an enhancement; choose when you create the companion. If you animate more than one corpse, each of them gains the same enhancement. You can choose from the Basic Enhancements.

### Tier 4 - Master of the Undead
**Double Enhancement.** You can enhance your Reanimated Corpse with one additional enhancement and you can now choose enhancements twice, doubling their effects or enhancing them even further.
**Command Undead.** In addition, as an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your Wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.
Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.
