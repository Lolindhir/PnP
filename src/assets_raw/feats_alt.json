    "explanation": "• The size of the damage die for natural weapons increases by one (d4 becomes d6, d6 becomes d8, and so on).<br>• Your natural weapons now have the finesse property.<br>• You can enter a state of bestial fury as a reaction until the start of your next turn. While in this state, you have disadvantage on attack rolls, but you double the damage dice dealt by your natural weapon attacks. You can enter this state a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier per long rest."
