Your character's background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative before your character embarked on a life of adventure.



### Parts of a Background [none]
A background includes the following parts:

**Connection.** A background provides a character with connections such as membership in a faction, contacts with specific organizations, or benefits from their own heritage.

**Background Feature.** Each background provides a unique feature that represents a special ability or benefit your character gains from their background. This feature can offer various advantages, such as special knowledge, connections, or abilities that can be used during your adventures.

**Starting Feat.** A background gives your character a starting feat, which grants your character particular capabilities.

**Skill Proficiencies.** A background gives your character proficiency in two specified skills.

**Tool Proficiencies.** Most backgrounds give your character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools are detailed in the {rule}[Tools section](tools).

**Weapon Proficiencies.** A few backgrounds give your character proficiency with one or more weapons. Weapons are detailed in the {rule}[Weapons section](weapons).

**Languages.** Each background gives you a number of languages you understand and can speak. Languages are detailed in the {rule}[Languages Glossary entry](languages).
