Here are the steps to make a character:
<div class="listNoGap"></div>

1. **Choose a Race**
2. **Choose a Class**
3. **Choose a Background**
4. **Determine Ability Scores**
5. **Choose Intelligence Bonuses**
6. **Determine Mechanical Details**
7. **Describe your Character**
8. **Choose Equipment**



## Step 1: Choose a Race [none]
Choose a race for your character. The available races are summarized in the {rule}[Race Overview table](race_list). See the {rule}[Race section](races) for the races' details. 
Your chosen race influences step 4, when you determine your character's ability scores, and determines your character's size and Speed. Additionally, it gives you special traits.



## Step 2: Choose a Class [none]
Choose a class for your character. The available classes are summarized in the {rule}[Class Overview table](class_list). See the {rule}[Class section](classes) for the classes' details. 
You gain all the traits in the class' Core Traits table and the class' level 1 features.



## Step 3: Choose a Background [none]
Choose your character's background. You can choose any of the pre made backgrounds detailed in the {rule}[Sample Backgrounds section](backgrounds_samples) or create a custom background for yourself, using the rules described in the {rule}[Backgrounds section](backgrounds).
You gain all the benefits a background provides (connection, feature, proficiencies, languages, and starting feat).



## Step 4: Determine Ability Scores [none]

### Choose an Ability Score Combination [none]
To determine your ability scores, you will use a defined array of ability scores. These scores can then be freely assigned to the six abilities. You can choose from the following five combinations:

| <!-- --> | <!-- --> | <!-- --> | <!-- --> | <!-- --> | <!-- --> | <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
| -------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------- |
|          |    15    |    15    |    13    |    10    |    10    |    8     |          |
|          |    15    |    14    |    14    |    10    |    10    |    8     |          |
|        * |  **15**  |  **14**  |  **13**  |  **12**  |  **10**  |  **8**   | *        |
|          |    14    |    14    |    14    |    12    |    10    |    8     |          |
|          |    14    |    14    |    13    |    12    |    12    |    8     |          |

**standard array*

{index}[Ability Score Array]()
{index}[Standard Array]()

### Adjust Ability Scores [none]
After assigning your ability scores, adjust them according to your race and possibly your background. 
*Constraint: After adjusting, no ability score can exceed a value of 17.*

**Adjustment based on your Race.** Increase one score of you choice by 2 and a different one by 1. The +2 must be applied to one of the main abilities of your race, while the +1 can be applied to any ability score. Alternatively, you can increase three scores by 1 (at least one of those scores must be a main ability score of your race).

**Racial Bonus.** Some races give a bonus to an ability score. Apply this bonus.

**Background Feat Adjustment.** Your background allows you to gain a feat. If you choose the Ability Score Increase feat, apply the chosen ability's bonus.

### Determine Ability Modifiers [none]
Finally, determine your ability modifiers using the {rule}[Ability Modifiers table](ability_modifiers).



## Step 5: Choose Intelligence Bonuses [none]
For positive Intelligence modifiers, you receive points that you can spend on additional proficiencies or languages when creating your character. For example, if you have an Intelligence score of 15, you have a modifier of +2 and would receive 2 points to invest. The table below shows all the bonuses you can spend your points on.

##### Intelligence Bonuses table [Bonuses for Intelligence]
| Cost | Bonus                                                                          |
| :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | Knowledge Skill (Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion) *(only available once)* |
|  1   | Tool Proficiency                                                               |
|  1   | Standard Language                                                              |
|  2   | Rare Language                                                                  |
|  2   | Class Skill (Skills available through class)                                   |
|  2   | Expertise in Knowledge Skill                                                   |
|  3   | Skill (any)                                                                    |



## Step 6: Determine Mechanical Details [none]

**Proficiency Bonus.** The {rule}[Proficiency bonus](proficiency) table shows your Proficiency Bonus, which is +2 for a level 1 character.

**Saving Throws.** The modifier for saving throws you're not proficient in is the appropriate ability modifier. For the saving throws you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the appropriate ability modifier.

**Skills.** The modifier for skills you're not proficient in is the associated ability modifier, as described in the {rule}[Skills Overview](skills). For skills you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated with that skill.

**Passive Insight, Investigation, and Perception.** Sometimes your DM will determine whether your character notices something without asking you to make a Wisdom (Insight) Intelligence (Investigation), or Wisdom (Perception) check; the DM uses your Passive scores instead. Use this formula to determine your Passive scores:
<div class="listNoGap"></div>

> Passive Score = 10 + associated check modifier
<div class="listNoGap"></div>

Include all modifiers that apply to the checks. For example, if your character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Perception skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 for your Wisdom modifier + 2 for proficiency).

**Hit Points.** Your class and Constitution modifier determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1:
<div class="listNoGap"></div>

> Starting Hit Points = maximum value of your class' hit point die + your Constitution modifier

**Hit Point Dice.** Your class's description tells you the die type of your character's Hit Point Dice (or Hit Dice for short). At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You can spend Hit Dice during a Night Rest to recover Hit Points.

**Initiative.** Your Dexterity modifier is your Initiative.

**Armor Class.** Without armor or a shield, your base Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If your starting equipment includes armor or a shield (or both), calculate your AC using the rules in the {rule}[Armor section](armor). A class feature might give you a different way to calculate your AC.

**Attacks.** The attack roll bonus for a weapon with which you have proficiency is one of the following unless a weapon's property says otherwise:
<div class="listNoGap"></div>

- Melee attack bonus = Strength modifier + Proficiency Bonus
- Ranged attack bonus = Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus
<div class="listNoGap"></div>

Look up the damage and properties of your weapons in the {rule}[Weapons section](weapons). You add the same ability modifier you use for attacks with a weapon to your damage rolls with that weapon.

**Spellcasting.**
<div class="listNoGap"></div>

- Spell save DC = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus
- Spell attack bonus = spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus
<div class="listNoGap"></div>

Your spellcasting ability modifier for a spell is determined by whatever feature gives you the ability to cast the spell.

**Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells.** If your class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, your class features table shows the number of spell slots you have available, how many cantrips and spells you know, and how many spells you can prepare. Choose your known cantrips and spells and then prepare spells.



## Step 7: Describe your Character [none]

### Considering your Past and Present [none]
Let your character's background and species inspire how you imagine their past. That past fed into the character's present. With that in mind, consider answers to the following questions as your character:
<div class="listNoGap"></div>

- Who raised you?
- Who was your dearest childhood friend?
- Did you grow up with a pet?
- Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?
- Did you join an organization, such as a guild or religion? If so, are you still a member of it?
- What elements of your past inspire you to go on adventures now?

### Choose an Alignment [none]
Choose your character's alignment from the options described in the {rule}[Alignment Details](alignment) page. D&D assumes that player characters aren't of an evil alignment. Check with your DM before making an evil character.

### Choose your Character's Personality and Traits [none]
Depending on your character's alignment and past, determine you character's personality as described in the {rule}[Character Traits](character_traits) section. 



## Step 8: Choose Equipment [none]
You have 50 silver pieces (see {rule}[Coin section](coins)) as your starting wealth. With these coins, you can buy {rule}[weapons](weapons), {rule}[armor](armor), {rule}[tools](tools), and {rule}[adventuring gear](adventuring_gear).
