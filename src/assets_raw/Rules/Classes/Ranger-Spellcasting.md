## Spellcasting

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

**Spell Slots.** The Available Spell Slots table above shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells per Adventuring Period.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two Level 1 spells from the Ranger spell list.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the the Prepared Spells table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Ranger spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 9 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include nine spells of levels 1, 2, and 3 in any combination.
If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.

|      19      |       15        |

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you start an Adventuring Period, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Ranger spells for which you have spell slots.
If you are using the Gritty Realism variant, you can change your list whenever you finish a Night Rest, but spells with currently active effects have to remain prepared.
