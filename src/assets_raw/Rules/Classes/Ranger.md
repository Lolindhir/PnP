Far from bustling cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch in the wilderness. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.
Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger's talents and magic are honed with deadly focus to protect the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

### Level 1: Favored Enemy [none]
You always have the *{spell}[Hunter's Mark]()* spell prepared.
You can cast it twice at 2nd level without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a Long Rest.
Additionally, the level at which you cast the spell increases when you reach certain Ranger levels: 3rd at 5th level, 4th at 9th level, and 5th at 13th level.


### Level 1: Weapon Mastery [none]
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Longswords.


### Level 2: Deft Explorer [none]
Thanks to your travels, you gain the following benefits:

**Expertise.** Choose one of your skill proficiencies with which you lack Expertise. You gain Expertise in that skill.

**Wanderer’s Adaptation.** Your experience surviving in distant lands has shaped your body and senses. Choose one of the following options:

- **Languages.** You learn two languages of your choice from the language tables in chapter 2.
- **Darkvision.** You gain Darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. If you already have Darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet, to a maximum of 60 feet.
- **Swim Speed.** You gain a swim speed equal to your Speed. If you already have a swim speed, it increases by 10 feet.
- **Climb Speed.** You gain a climb speed equal to your Speed. If you already have a climb speed, it increases by 10 feet.


### Level 2: Fighting Style [none]
You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see chapter 5). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

**Druidic Warrior.** You learn two Druid cantrips of your choice (see the Druid class's section for a list of Druid spells). Guidance and Starry Wisp are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Druid cantrip.


### Level 2: Hunter's Lore [none]
You can call on the forces of nature to reveal certain strengths and weaknesses of your prey. While a creature is marked by your *{spell}[Hunter's Mark]()*, you know whether that creature has any Immunities, Resistances, or Vulnerabilities, and if the creature has any, you know what they are.


### Level 3: Ranger Subclass [none]
You gain a Ranger subclass of your choice. The Beast Master, Fey Wanderer, Gloom Stalker, and Hunter subclasses are detailed after this class's description.

A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Ranger level or lower.


### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement [none]
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Ranger levels 8, 12, and 16.


### Level 5: Extra Attack [none]
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


### Level 6: Hunter’s Stance [Hunter's Stance]
Starting at 6th level, you can deliberately shift your combat posture to embody different aspects of the hunt.
During combat, you can enter a Hunter’s Stance as a bonus action, or as a reaction when you make an attack or when a creature makes an attack against you. A Hunter’s Stance represents a focused battle stance that blends offensive hunting techniques and defensive adaptations.
You can have only one Hunter’s Stance active at a time. Entering a new Hunter’s Stance immediately ends your current stance. A Hunter’s Stance can be entered only during combat and ends automatically at the end of combat.

When you gain this feature at 6th level, you have access to all of the following Hunter’s Stances:
- **Colossus Slayer Stance.** You focus on wearing down wounded prey. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the attack deals an extra 1d8 damage if the target is missing any of its Hit Points.
- **Horde Breaker Stance.** You position yourself to strike through clustered enemies. Once on each of your turns, when you make a weapon attack, you can make one additional attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target, within the weapon’s range, and that you have not attacked this turn.
- **Escape the Horde Stance.** You stay in constant motion, avoiding surrounding threats. Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.
- **Multiattack Defense Stance.** You anticipate follow-up strikes and adjust your defenses accordingly. When a creature hits you with an attack roll, that creature has disadvantage on all other attack rolls it makes against you until the end of the current turn.

As you gain levels in this class, your mastery of Hunter’s Stances may deepen, allowing existing stances to improve, reflecting your growing expertise as an adaptable and relentless hunter.


### Level 6: Roving [none]
Your Speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armor.
You, and creatures of your choice traveling with you, do not suffer penalties for traveling at a Normal or Fast pace.


### Level 9: Expertise [none]
Choose two of your skill proficiencies with which you lack Expertise. You gain Expertise in those skills.


### Level 10: Tireless [none]
Primal forces now help fuel you on your journeys, granting you the following benefits.

**Temporary Hit Points.** As a Magic action, you can give yourself a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You can use this action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

**Endurance.** Whenever you would gain one or more levels of Exhaustion, you can expend a spell slot to steel yourself against the strain. Reduce the levels of Exhaustion gained by a number equal to the level of the spell slot expended (minimum of 1).
You cannot reduce the Exhaustion gained below 0.

**Decrease Exhaustion.** Whenever you finish a Short Rest, your Exhaustion level, if any, decreases by 1.

### Level 13: Improved Hunter’s Stance [none]
Starting at 13th level, your mastery of the hunt allows you to draw greater benefits from your chosen Hunter’s Stance. While a Hunter’s Stance is active, it gains the following additional effects.
- **Colossus Slayer Stance.** The extra damage dealt by this stance increases to 2d8.
- **Horde Breaker Stance.** When you use this stance, you can make two additional attacks instead of one when its conditions are met. Each additional attack must target a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target, within the weapon’s range, and that you have not attacked this turn.
- **Escape the Horde Stance.** When you enter this stance, you can immediately take the Disengage action as part of the same action or reaction used to enter the stance.
- **Multiattack Defense Stance.** While this stance is active, whenever a creature hits you with an attack roll, you gain a +1 bonus to AC against subsequent attacks made by that creature until the end of the current turn, increasing by +1 for each additional attack that creature makes against you this turn.

### Level 13: Relentless Hunter [none]
At 13th level, your focus on the hunt becomes unbreakable in the chaos of battle.
When you are concentrating on a ranger spell, taking damage cannot break your concentration on that spell. You still lose concentration as normal if you are incapacitated, cast another spell that requires concentration, or choose to end the effect.

### Level 13: Relentless Hunter [none]
The damage die of your *Hunter's Mark* is a d10 rather than a d6.


### Level 14: Nature's Veil [none]
You invoke spirits of nature to magically hide yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can give yourself the Invisible condition until the end of your next turn.
You may extend your Nature's Veil for another round by taking an Action to extend it, in which case it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain Nature's Veil for up to 10 minutes.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.


### Level 17: Precise Hunter [none]
You have Advantage on attack rolls against the creature currently marked by your Hunter's Mark.


### Level 18: Feral Senses [none]
Your connection to the forces of nature grants you Blindsight with a range of 30 feet.

### Level 18: Master of the Hunt [none]
At 18th level, your mastery of the hunt allows you to strike with devastating precision.
Whenever you deal damage with Hunter’s Mark, all of its damage dice are doubled.


### Level 19: Epic Boon [none]
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.

### Level 20: Apex of the Hunt [none]
At 20th level, you embody the ultimate predator, seamlessly maintaining multiple magical effects while relentlessly pursuing your quarry.
All ranger spells you cast no longer require concentration. If a spell would normally end when your concentration is broken, it instead lasts for its full duration, unless ended early by its own conditions.
In addition, when you cast Hunter’s Mark, or move it to a new creature, you can do so without using a bonus action.
