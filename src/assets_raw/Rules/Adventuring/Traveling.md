During an adventure, the characters might travel long distances on trips that could take hours or days. The DM can summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times, or the DM might have you use the travel pace rules below. If you need to know how fast you can move when every second matters, see the movement rules in  {rule}["Combat"](combat).

### Marching Order
The adventurers should establish a marching order while they travel, whether indoors or outdoors. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies if a fight breaks out. You can change your marching order outside combat and record the order any way you like: write it down, for example, or arrange miniatures to show it.

### Travel Pace [none]
While traveling outside combat, a group can move at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time; if riding horses or other mounts, the group can move twice that distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need a Short or Long Rest before they can move at that increased pace again (see the {rule}["Equipment" section](equipment) for a selection of mounts for sale). The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules that affect which pace you can choose in certain types of terrain.

##### Travel Pace [none]
| Pace   | Minute   | Hour    | Day      |
| :----- | :------- | :------ | :------- |
| Fast   | 400 feet | 4 miles | 30 miles |
| Normal | 300 feet | 3 miles | 24 miles |
| Slow   | 200 feet | 2 miles | 18 miles |

Each travel pace has a game effect, as defined below.
**Fast.** Traveling at a Fast pace imposes Disadvantage on a traveler's Wisdom (Perception or Survival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
**Normal.** Traveling at a Normal pace imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
**Slow.** Traveling at a Slow pace grants Advantage on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks.

### Vehicles [Vehicle Travel]
Travelers in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don't choose a travel pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.
