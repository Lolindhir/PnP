- Spells you cast ignore Resistance to damage of your Fiendish Legacy's type.
- When you roll damage for a spell you cast that deals damage of your Fiendish Legacy's type, you can reroll any roll of 1 on the damage dice, but you must use the new roll, even if it is another 1.
- Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage of your Fiendish Legacy's type, you can cause its magic to wreathe you until the end of your next turn. While the magic is present, any creature within 5 feet of you that hits you with a melee attack takes 1d4 damage of your Fiendish Legacy's type. This damage increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level.
