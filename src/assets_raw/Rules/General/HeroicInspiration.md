**Usage.** If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you must use the new roll.

**Only One at a Time.** You can never have more than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If something gives you Heroic Inspiration and you already have it, you can give it to a player character in your group who lacks it.

**Gaining Heroic Inspiration:**
- You can spend one white {rule}[Schicksalspunkt](schicksalspunkte) to give yourself Heroic Inspiration if you haven't it already. 
- Your DM can give you Heroic Inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you do something particularly heroic, in character, or entertaining. It's a reward for making the game more fun for everyone playing.
- Other rules might allow your character to gain Heroic Inspiration independent of the DM's decision. For example, Human characters start each day with Heroic Inspiration.
