The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can't fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.<br> While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can't attack or cast spells. ;Druid (Spores);Druid (Spores)
3;Plant Growth;3rd level Transmutation;1 action or 8 hours;150 feet;V, S;Instantaneous;This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.<br> If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.<br> You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.<br> If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. ;Druid (Wildfire);Druid (Wildfire)
3;Revivify;3rd level Necromancy;1 action;Touch;V, S, M;Instantaneous;(diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes)You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.;Druid (Wildfire);Druid (Wildfire)
4;Blight;4th level Necromancy;1 action;30 feet;V, S;Instantaneous;Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.<br> If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.<br> If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.<br> <b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th. ;Druid (*)(Desert);Druid (Land Desert)
4;Control Water;4th level Transmutation;1 action;300 feet;V, S, M;Concentration, up to 10 minutes;(a drop of water and a pinch of dust)Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.<br> <b>Flood</b>: You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.<br> If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.<br> The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.<br> <b>Part Water</b>: You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.<br> <b>Redirect Flow</b>: You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.<br> <b>Whirlpool</b>: This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.<br> When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.<br> The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage, this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.;Druid (*)(Coast);Druid (Land Coast)
4;Divination (ritual);4th level Divination;1 action;Self;V, S, M;Instantaneous;(incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god's servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.<br> The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.<br> If you cast this spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret. ;Druid (Grassland)(Forest);Druid (Land Forest), Druid (Land Grassland)
4;Greater Invisibility;4th level Illusion;1 action;Touch;V, S;Concentration, up to 1 minute;You or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person.;Druid (Underdark);Druid (Land Underdark)
4;Hallucinatory Terrain;4th level Illusion;10 minutes;300 feet;V, S, M;24 hours;(a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.<br> The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain. ;Druid (*)(Desert);Druid (Land Desert)
4;Ice Storm;4th level Evocation;1 action;300 feet;V, S, M;Instantaneous;(a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br> Hailstones turn the storm's area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.<br> <b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th. ;Druid (*)(Arctic);Druid (Land Arctic)
4;Locate Creature;4th level Divination;1 action;Self;V, S, M;Concentration, up to 1 hour;(a bit of fur from a bloodhound)Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature's location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.<br> The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close - within 30 feet - at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a <i>polymorph</i> spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.<br> This spell can't locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature. ;Druid (*)(Swamp);Druid (Land Swamp)
4;Stone Shape;4th level Transmutation;1 action;Touch;V, S, M;Instantaneous;(soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.;Druid (*)(Underdark)(Mountain);Druid (Land Mountain), Druid (Land Underdark)

The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

4;Confusion;4th level Enchantment ;1 action;90 feet;V, S, M;Concentration, up to 1 minute;(3 nut shells)This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled actions. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.<br> An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.<br> 1: The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn.<br> 2-6: The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.<br> 7-8: The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach.

4;Aura of Life;4th level Abjuration;1 action;Self (30-foot radius);V;Concentration, up to 10 minutes;Life-preserving energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each non-hostile creature in the aura (including you) has resistance to necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum can't be reduced.

5;Cloudkill;5th level Conjuration;1 action;120 feet;V, S;Concentration, up to 10 minutes;You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range.

The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.<br> The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.<br> <b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.;Druid (Underdark);Druid (Land Underdark)
5;Commune with Nature (ritual);5th level Divination;1 minute;Self;V, S;Instantaneous;You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet.

5;Conjure Elemental;5th level Conjuration;1 minute;90 feet;V, S, M;Concentration, up to 1 hour;(burning incense for air, soft clay for earth, sulfur and phosphorus for fire, or water and sand for water)You call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An elemental of challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.<br> The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.<br> If your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn't disappear.

An uncontrolled elemental can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.<br> The DM has the elemental's statistics.<br> <b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th. ;Druid (*)(Coast);Druid (Land Coast)
5;Dream;5th level Illusion;1 minute;Special;V, S, M;8 hours;(a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)This spell shapes a creature's dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, can't be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can't take actions or move.<br> If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target's dreams.<br> You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target's sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.<br> If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target's body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage. ;Druid (Grassland);Druid (Land Grassland)

You choose the opening's dimensions - up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.<br> When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell. ;Druid (Mountain);Druid (Land Mountain)
5;Scrying;5th level Divination;10 minutes;Self;V, S, M;Concentration, up to 10 minutes;(a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water)You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.<br> <b>Knowledge</b> - Secondhand (you have heard of the target) +5. Firsthand (you have met the target) +0. Familiar (you know the target well) -5.<br> <b>Connection</b> Likeness or picture -2. Possession or garment -4. Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like -10.<br> On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell against it again for 24 hours.<br> On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.<br> Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move. ;Druid (*)(Swamp)(Coast);Druid (Land Coast), Druid (Land Swamp)
5;Tree Stride;5th level Conjuration;1 action;Self;V, S;Concentration, up to 1 minute;You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you're in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.<br> You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree. ;Druid (*)(Forest);Druid (Land Forest)
5;Wall of Stone;5th level Evocation;1 action;120 feet;V, S, M;Concentration, up to 10 minutes;(a small block of granite)A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least on other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.<br> If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.<br> The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or resting on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.<br> If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.<br> The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.<br> If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends. ;Druid (*)(Mountain)(Desert);Druid (Land Mountain), Druid (Land Desert)
5;Cloudkill;5th level Conjuration;1 action;120 feet;V, S;Concentration, up to 10 minutes;You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range.

Its area is heavily obscured.<br> When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.<br> The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.<br> <b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.;Druid (Spores);Druid (Spores)
5;Contagion;5th level Necromancy;1 action;Touch;V, S;7 days;Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.<br> At the end of each of the target's turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease's effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.<br> Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.<br> <b>Blinding Sickness</b>: Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.<br> <b>Filth Fever</b>: A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.<br> <b>Flesh Rot</b>: The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.<br> <b>Mindfire</b>: The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the confusion spell during combat.<br> <b>Seizure</b>: The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.<br> <b>Slimy Doom</b>: The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn. ;Druid (Spores);Druid (Spores)
