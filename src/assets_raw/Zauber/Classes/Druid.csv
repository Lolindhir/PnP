3;Revivify;3rd level Necromancy;1 action;Touch;V, S, M;Instantaneous;(diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes) You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.;Player's Handbook;Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Cleric (Grave), Cleric (Life), Druid (Wildfire), Sorcerer (Divine Good), Warlock (Celestial);
3;Sleet Storm;3rd level Conjuration;1 action;150 feet;V, S, M;Concentration, up to 1 minute;(a pinch of dust and a few drops of water) Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.<br> The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.<br> If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.;Player's Handbook;Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, Cleric (Tempest), Druid (Land Arctic), Sorcerer (Draconic White/Silver), Warlock (Fathomless), Warlock (Genie Marid);
3;Speak with Plants;3rd level Transmutation;1 action;Self (30-foot radius);V, S;10 minutes;You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell's area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.<br> You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.<br> Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM's discretion. The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.<br> If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.<br> This spell can cause the plants created by the <i>entangle</i> spell to release a restrained creature.;Player's Handbook;Bard, Druid, Ranger;
3;Tidal Wave;3rd level Conjuration;1 action;120 feet;V, S, M;Instantaneous;(a drop of water) You conjure up a wave of water that crashes down on an area within range. The area can be up to 30 feet long, up to 10 feet wide, and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. The water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in its area and within 30 feet of it, and then it vanishes.;Xanathar's Guide to Everything;Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, Druid (Four Elements Water);
3;Wall of Water;3rd level Evocation;1 action;60 feet;V, S, M;Concentration, up to 10 minutes;(a drop of water) You create a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall's space is difficult terrain.<br> Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot-square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall's water doesn't fill it.;Xanathar's Guide to Everything;Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, Druid (Four Elements Water);
3;Water Breathing (Ritual);3rd level Transmutation;1 action;30 feet;V, S, M;24 hours;(a short reed or piece of straw) This spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.;Player's Handbook;Artificer, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard, Druid (Land Coast);
3;Water Cannon;3rd level Evocation;1 action;Self (30-foot line);V, S;Instantaneous;You unleash a spout of water that blasts out in a line 30-foot long and 5 foot-wide line. Creatures in the area must make a Strength saving throw, or take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and be pushed to an open space at the end of the line away from you. If there is no open space to move to (for example they would move into a wall or another creature), they are pushed to the closest space and take an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and are not pushed.;KibblesTasty;Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard;
3;Water Walk (Ritual);3rd level Transmutation;1 action;30 feet;V, S, M;1 hour;(a piece of cork) This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface - such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava - as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.<br> If your target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.;Player's Handbook;Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Druid (Four Elements Water), Druid (Land Coast), Druid (Land Swamp);
3;Wind Wall;3rd level Evocation;1 action;120 feet;V, S, M;Concentration, up to 1 minute;(a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin) A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.<br> When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br> The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can't pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can't pass through it.;Player's Handbook;Druid, Ranger, Artificer (Artillerist), Cleric (Nature), Druid (Four Elements Air), Sorcerer (Storm Sorcery), Warlock (Genie Djinni);
