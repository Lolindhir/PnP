### Necromancy Scribe
The gold and time you must spend to copy an necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.
Additionally, you can add spells available to the Necromancy Wizard Subclass to your spell book, even if they are no Wizard spells. For you, they count as Wizard spells.

### Necromancy Cantrips
You know the [Chill Touch](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Chill%2520Touch), [Spare the Dying](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Spare%2520the%2520Dying), and [Toll the Dead](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Toll%2520the%2520Dead) cantrips and have them always prepared. They don't count against the number of cantrips you can prepare.

Once per turn, when you kill one or more enemies with a Wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell's level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy.

The target regains 1 Hit Point, and each creature in a 10-foot Emanation originating from the target makes a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking Necrotic damage equal to 1d4 plus half your Wizard level (round up) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
