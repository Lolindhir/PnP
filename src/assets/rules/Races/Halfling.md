***Brave.*** You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Frightened condition.

***Halfling Nimbleness.*** You can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than you, but you can't stop in the same space.

***Luck.*** When you roll a 1 on the d20 of a D20 Test, you can reroll the die, and you must use the new roll.

***Naturally Stealthy.*** You can take the Hide action even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

***Second Chance.*** When a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
