**Spells Known of Level 1+.** You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

**Changing your Known Spells.** Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.


### Level 3: Mage Hand Legerdemain
When you cast *[Mage Hand](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Mage%2520Hand)*, you can cast it as a Bonus Action, and you can make the spectral hand Invisible. You can control the hand as a Bonus Action, and through it, you can make Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks.

### Level 9: Magical Ambush
If you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has Disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell on the same turn.

### Level 13: Versatile Trickster
You gain the ability to distract targets with your *[Mage Hand](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Mage%2520Hand)*. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.
Additionally, when you use the Trip option of your Cunning Strike on a creature, you can also use that option on another creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand.

### Level 17: Spell Thief
You gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.
Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can take a Reaction to force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least level 1 and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need to be a Wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you have the spell prepared. The creature
can't cast it until the 8 hours have passed.
You can steal a spell with this feature once during an Adventuring Period. If the creature succeeds on its save, you can still use this feature.
