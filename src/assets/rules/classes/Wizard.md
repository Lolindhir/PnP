### Level 1: Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

**Free Cantrip.** You know the *[Prestidigitation](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Prestidigitation)* cantrip and have it always prepared. It doesn't count against the number of Wizard cantrips you can prepare.

**Spellbook.** Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting ldentify.You determine the book's
appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.
The book contains the spells you know. It starts with five Wizard cantrips and six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice.

**Adding additional Spells to the Book.** Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two level 1+ Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the [Wizard Features table](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/wizard/wizard_features_table). The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.

**Copying a Spell into the Book.** When you find a Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it's of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50
GP. A cantrip takes 1 hour and costs 20 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.

**Copying the Book.** You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level
of the copied spell (30 minutes and 5 GP for a cantrip).
If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.

**Spell Slots.** The [Wizard Features table](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/wizard/wizard_features_table) shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells.
You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Cantrips.** You prepare three cantrips from your spellbook to cast with this feature.
When you reach Wizard level 4, the number of prepared cantrips increases to four. When you reach Wizard level 10, the number of prepared cantrips increases to five.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the the Prepared Spells table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from your spellbook until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, choosen from your spellbook.
If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.

|      20      |         5         |         25         |

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.
If you are using the Gritty Realism variant, you can change your list whenever you finish a Night Rest, but spells with currently active effects have to remain prepared.



### Level 1: Ritual Adept
You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn't have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.



### Level 1: Arcane Recovery
You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you're a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels' worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.



### Level 2: Scholar
While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You have Expertise in the chosen skill.



### Level 3: Wizard Subclass
You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Wizard level or lower.
- Abjurer
- Diviner
- [Evoker](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/wizard/evoker)
- Illusionist



### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain three feats of your choice, for which you qualify. You have to take the Ability Score Improvement feat at least once (two times is recommended).
You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 8, 12, and 16.



### Level 5: Memorize Spell
Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of the Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting feature with another spell from the book.



### Level 18: Spell Mastery
You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.



### Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat or three other feats of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.



### Level 20: Signature Spells
Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't cast them in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.
