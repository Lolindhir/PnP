## Base Class Stuff

### Level 1: Favored Enemy
You always have the *Hunter's Mark* spell prepared.
You can cast it twice at 2nd level without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a Long Rest.
Additionally, the level at which you cast the spell increases when you reach certain Ranger levels: 3rd at 5th level, 4th at 11th level, and 5th at 17th level.

### Level 13: Relentless Hunter
The damage die of your *Hunter's Mark* is a d10 rather than a d6.

### Level 20: Foe Slayer
Nice feature in the working...



## Hunter Stuff
Level noch schieben? auf ASIs?

### Level 3: Hunter's Lore
You can call on the forces of nature to reveal certain strengths and weaknesses of your prey. While a creature is marked by your *Hunter's Mark*, you know whether that creature has any Immunities, Resistances, or Vulnerabilities, and if the creature has any, you know what they are.

### Level 3: Hunter's Prey
beide FÃ¤higkeiten immer? oder vielleicht eine Art Stance -> in Stance gehen und wechseln kostet Bonus Action?

### Level 7: Defensive Tactics

### Level 11: Superior Hunter's Prey

### Level 15: Superior Hunter's Defense
