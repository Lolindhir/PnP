### Level 1: Spellcasting
Drawing on the elemental essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

**Free Cantrip.** You always know the *Elementalism* cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of Shaman cantrips you know.

**Known Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Shaman spell list.
Whenever you gain a Shaman level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Shaman spell list.
When you reach Shaman levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Shaman spell list.

**Spell Slots.** The Shaman Features Table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells.
You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four Level 1 spells from the Shaman spell list.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Shaman levels, as shown in the the Prepared Spells table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Shaman spell list until the number of spells on your
list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Shaman, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.
If another Shaman feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Shaman spells for you.

##### Prepared Spells Table
| Shaman Level | Prepared Spells |
| :----------: | :-------------: |
|      1       |        4        |
|      2       |        5        |
|      3       |        6        |
|      4       |        7        |
|      5       |        8        |
|      6       |        8        |
|      7       |        9        |
|      8       |        9        |
|      9       |       10        |
|      10      |       10        |
|      11      |       11        |
|      12      |       11        |
|      13      |       12        |
|      14      |       12        |

|      16      |       13        |
|      17      |       14        |
|      18      |       14        |
|      19      |       15        |
|      20      |       15        |

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Shaman spells for which you have spell slots.
If you are using the Gritty Realism variant, you can change your list whenever you finish a Night Rest, but spells with currently active effects have to remain prepared.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Shaman spells.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Shaman spells.



### Level 1: Speaker of Two Worlds
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can't decipher it without magic.
Additionally, you know Infernal, the language of the elementals.



### Level 1: Elemental Role
While training with the elements, you have dedicated yourself to one of the following roles of your choice.

**Sage.**
- You know one extra cantrip from the Shaman spell list.
- You know the *Resistance* cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of Shaman cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, and you can cast it as a Bonus Action.
- Your connection to the elements gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

**Warrior.**
- Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Shields.
- You know the *Shillelagh* cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of Shaman cantrips you know. Instead of dealing Force damage with the weapon imbued by this cantrip, you deal either Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice). Additionally, you are allowed to use the mastery property of the imbued weapon.
- You know the *Absorb Elements* spell to ward yourself against the harmful nature of the elements, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.



### Level 2: Elemental Call

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to call forth one elemental aspect you know. The elemental aspect surrounds you and you gain benefits depending on the kind of aspect - Air, Earth, Fire, or Water - which are described below. The elemental aspect surrounds you for 1 minute, until you use your bonus action to dismiss it, until you use this feature again to call another aspect with an action, or until you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.


**Aspects Known.** At 2nd level, you know the elemental aspect connected to the element you have chosen for your circle spells. When you gain certain druid levels, you gain additional aspects of your choice. At 6th, 10th and 14th level you can choose an additional elemental aspect. As you gain levels, your choices could reflect the elements you have encountered on your adventures. 



#### Air Aspect

Wind whirls around you, enhancing your mobility on the battlefield.

<div style='margin-top:-10px;'></div>

* Ranged weapon attacks made against you have disadvantage on the attack roll.
* You have resistance against damage and advantage on saving throws against effects caused by harmful fog, smoke or other gases.
* When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to succeed on that saving throw instead.
* You can take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action.
* Your jump height and distance are doubled and you gain advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks related to jumping.
* You can cast *feather fall* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components, without needing to concentrate on the spell and without being able to cast spells. Once you reach 4th druid level you can cast *levitate* and once you reach 8th druid level you can cast *fly* the same way. If the Air Aspect no longer surrounds you, a spell cast this way doesn't end immediately, instead it ends normally after the spell's duration and you now have to concentrate on it if the spell requires concentration. 
* **Sonic Shock.** As an action, you can expend a spell slot to compress the wind surrounding you and release it in a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet. When you expend a spell slot of 1st level, each creature within 5 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes deafened and incapacitated until the start of your next turn by the intense sound. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save. When you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the range of this effect is increased by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 1st.


#### Earth Aspect

Bits of rock spread across your body, strengthening your melee and defensive capabilities.

<div style='margin-top:-10px;'></div>

* Your AC can't be less than 14 + your proficiency bonus.
* You gain temporary hit points equal to 4 times your druid level until you dismiss or drop the earth aspect.
* You can't cast spells, but calling the Earth Aspect doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you've already cast. When you reach 20th druid level, this restriction no longer applies to you.
* You can use Wisdom instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes. Also they do double damage to objects and structures. Additionally, you can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. This die changes when you reach 5th druid level (d8), 11th druid level (d10), and 17th druid level (d12).
* If you attacked this turn with an unarmed strike or your Rock Smash, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
* **Rock Smash.** As an action, you can expend a spell slot to focus the rock surrounding you at your fist and make a mighty blow. When you expend a spell slot of 1st level, make a melee attack against one creature you can reach, using either Strength or Wisdom. On a hit, the target takes 2d12 bludgeoning damage and must make a Strength saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. A huge creature has advantage and a gargantuan creature automatically succeeds on the save. When you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each spell slot level above 1st.


#### Fire Aspect

Flames race across your body, allowing you constant, empowered ranged attacks.

<div style='margin-top:-10px;'></div>

* You have resistance against cold damage.
* You shed bright light out to 10 feet and dim light for an additional 10 feet. 
* Any creature within 5 feet of you that hits you with a melee attack takes fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
* You can use an action to hurl a fire beam at a creature or object within 120 feet. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 + your proficiency bonus fire damage. A flammable object hit by the beam ignites if it isn't being worn or carried. You can hurl more beams when you reach higher druid levels: two beams at 5th druid level, three beams at 11th druid level, and four beams at 17th druid level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.
* **Flaming Burst.** As an action, you can expend a spell slot to cause fire erupting from your hands. When you expend a spell slot of 1st level, each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. When you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each and the range increases by 5 feet for every two spell slot level(s) above 1st.

#### Water Aspect

Water flows around your body, serving as catalyst to help healing wounds taken in battle.

<div style='margin-top:-10px;'></div>

* You have resistance against fire and acid damage.
* You have a swimming speed of 40 feet and can breathe underwater.
* You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to prevent and escape from being grappled.
* At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to half your proficiency bonus.
* **Healing Flow.** As an action, you can expend a spell slot to channel the regenerating properties of water and heal a creature you touch. When you expend a spell slot of 1st level, the creature regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your proficiency bonus + half your druid level (rounded up). When you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1st.





### Level 2: Wild Shape
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. 

**Number of Uses.** You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Number of Wild Shapes table.

##### Number of Wild Shapes
| Druid Level | Wild Shapes |
| :---------: | :---------: |
|      1      |      -      |
|      2      |      2      |
|      6      |      3      |
|     17      |      4      |

**Known Forms.** Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.

##### Beast Shapes
| Druid Level | Known Forms | Max CR | Fly Speed |
| :---------: | :---------: | :----: | :-------: |
|      2      |      4      |  1/4   |    No     |
|      4      |      6      |  1/2   |    No     |
|      8      |      8      |   1    |    Yes    |

**Beast Shape.** You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.
While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
- When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
- You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.




Druids who are members of the Circle of the Four Elements hail from regions that have strong ties to the Elemental Planes of Existence and often reside near portals to these planes. They see it as their duty to protect the civilization from the creatures who inhabit the Elemental Planes and pose a threat to the Material Plane. Simultaneously, these druids share a special bond to elemental creatures. Their magic is fueled by the four elements, from the healing capabilities of water to the devasting power of fire. As a member of this circle, your magic is especially influenced by the element of the plane your circle guards.


##### Circle of the Four Elements Features


| Druid Level | Feature |
|:-----------:|:--------|
| 2nd | Elemental Recovery, Elemental Ward, <br>Circle Spells, Elemental Call |
| 6th | Elemental Summoning, <br>Additional Elemental Aspect |
| 10th | Focused Elemental Summoning, <br>Additional Elemental Aspect |
| 14th | Durable Elemental Summoning, <br>Improved Elemental Call, <br>Additional Elemental Aspect |
| 18th | Genie Summoning |
| 20th | Avatar of the Elements |




### Elemental Recovery

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with the elements. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1sI-leveI slots.



### Level 3: Elemental Aspect Spells

Your connection to the elements infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the element of the circle where you became a druid. Choose that element - Air, Earth, Fire, or Water - and consult the associated list of spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.






### Elemental Summoning
When you reach 6th level you gain the ability to physically manifest the elements from the Elemental Planes of existence. 

As an action, you can expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to summon an Elemental Manifestation that disappears after 1 hour, when it drops to 0 hit points, or when you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The creature appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 90 feet. It uses the Elemental Manifestation stat block at the end of this subclass description. When you summon the manifestation, choose an element: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. The creature physically resembles a vaguely humanoid form wreathed in the chosen element, which also determines some of the traits in its stat block.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.


### Focused Elemental Summoning
Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on your Elemental Summoning ability, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.


### Durable Elemental Summoning
From 14th level, the Elemental Manifestation that you summon with your Elemental Summoning ability has temporary hit points equal to ten times the elemental's Constitution modifier.


### Improved Elemental Call
Beginning at 14th level, you can expend two uses of elemental call at the same time to call forth two elemental aspects that will surround you.


### Genie Summoning
Starting at 18th level, when you use your Elemental Summoning ability and expend a spell slot of 9th level, you can summon a genie - Djinni (air), Dao (earth), Efreeti (fire), or Marid (water) - instead of the Elemental Manifestation. The Dungeon Master has the genie’s statistics.


### Avatar of the Elements
At 20th level, you have ultimately mastered all four elements and can call them simultaneously to aid you in battle.

If you use your Improved Elemental Call feature and expend two uses of Elemental Call at the same time, you now surround yourself with all four elemental aspects instead of only two of them.
