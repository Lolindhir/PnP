Shamans hail from regions that have strong ties to the Elemental Planes of Existence and often reside near portals to these planes. They see it as their duty to protect the civilization from the creatures who inhabit the Elemental Planes and pose a threat to the Material Plane. Simultaneously, they share a special bond to elemental creatures. Their magic is fueled by the four elements, from the healing capabilities of water to the devastating power of fire.

### Level 1: Spellcasting
Drawing on the elemental essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom or Charisma (your choice when choosing this class) is your spellcasting ability for your Shaman spells.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability's modifier
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability's modifier

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Shaman spells.

**Free Cantrip.** You always know the *[Elementalism](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Elementalism)* cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of Shaman cantrips you know.

**Known Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Shaman spell list.
Whenever you gain a Shaman level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Shaman spell list.

**Spell Slots.** The [Shaman Features Table](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/shaman/shaman_features_table) shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells.
You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two Level 1 spells from the Shaman spell list.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Shaman levels, as shown in the the Prepared Spells table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Shaman spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Shaman, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of levels 1, 2, and 3 in any combination.
If another Shaman feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Shaman spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Shaman spells for which you have spell slots.
If you are using the Gritty Realism variant, you can change your list whenever you finish a Night Rest, but spells with currently active effects have to remain prepared.




### Level 1: Speaker of Two Worlds
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids and shamans. You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can't decipher it without magic.
Additionally, you know Primordial, the language of the elementals.



### Level 1: Elemental Role
While training with the elements, you have dedicated yourself to one of the following roles of your choice. Depending on your chosen role, you will gain additional features as you progress in this class.

**Sage.**
- You know one extra cantrip from the Shaman spell list.
- You know the *[Resistance](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Resistance)* cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of Shaman cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, its die is a d6 instead of a d4, and you can cast it as a Bonus Action.
- Your connection to the elements gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

**Warrior.**
- Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Shields.
- You know the *[Shillelagh](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Shillelagh)* cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of Shaman cantrips you know. Instead of dealing Force damage with the weapon imbued by this cantrip, you deal either Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice).
- You know the *[Absorb Elements](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Absorb%2520Elements)* spell to ward yourself against the harmful nature of the elements, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. For you, its damage dice are d8s instead of d6s.



### Level 2: Elemental Aspect
Your connection to the aspect of one element infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells and call to you the elements themselves to assist you. As you level up, you will learn to control more of the elemental aspects.

**Aspects Known.** At 2nd level, you know one Elemental Aspect of your choice. Choose between Air, Earth, Fire, or Water.
When you gain certain Shaman levels, you gain additional aspects of your choice. At 6th, 10th and 14th level you can choose an additional Elemental Aspect. As you gain levels, your choices could reflect the elements you have encountered on your adventures.

##### Known Aspects
| Shaman Level | Known Aspects |
| :----------: | :-----------: |
|      2       |       1       |
|      6       |       2       |
|      10      |       3       |
|      14      |       4       |


#### Aspect Spells
The connection to the Elemental Aspects grants you access to spells connected with these elements. Consult the associated lists of spells depending on your Elemental Role: [Sage Spells](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/shaman/shaman_spells_sage) or [Warrior Spells](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/shaman/shaman_spells_warrior).
You gain access to all listed Aspect Spells for which you have spell slots, for which you know the corresponding Aspect, and for which you have the required Elemental Role. You always have these spells prepared, and they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Shaman spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Shaman spell for you.


#### Aspect Call
You can use your bonus action to call forth one Elemental Aspect you know. The Elemental Aspect surrounds you and you gain benefits depending on the kind of aspect - Air, Earth, Fire, or Water - which are described in the [Elemental Aspect Calls overview page](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/shaman/shaman_aspect_calls). If a Aspect Call requires a spell attack or saving throw, use your spellcasting ability.
While the Aspect surrounds you, you can't cast spells other than cantrips, spells granted by your Elemental Role, and the corresponding spells of the called Elemental Aspect. Calling the Aspect doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *Witch Bolt*, that you've already cast.
The Elemental Aspect surrounds you for 1 minute, until you use your bonus action to dismiss it, until you use this feature again to call another aspect with an bonus action, or until you are incapacitated, fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. 

**Number of Uses.** You can use Aspect Call twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
You gain additional uses when you reach certain Shaman levels, as shown in the Aspect Calls table.

##### Aspect Calls
| Shaman Level | Aspect Call Uses |
| :----------: | :--------------: |
|      1       |        -         |
|      2       |        2         |
|      7       |        3         |
|      15      |        4         |



### Level 3: Elemental Resurgence
Once on each of your turns, you can convert uses of Aspect Call to spell slots and vice versa. The Resurgence Table below lists the minimum spell slot cost to gain a number of Aspect Call uses, the spell slot level you gain for a defined number of Aspect Call uses, and the minimum Shaman level you must be to convert certain amounts.
**Converting Spell Slots to Aspect Call Uses.** You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of expended Aspect Call uses (no action required). The Resurgence table lists the minimum spell slot you have to expend to regain a certain number of Aspect Call uses.
**Creating Spell Slots.** As a Bonus Action, you can convert unexpended Aspect Call uses into one spell slot. The Resurgence table shows the spell slot you gain for the amount of Aspect Call uses spend.

##### Resurgence Table
| Aspect Call Uses | Spell Slot Cost | Spell Slot Regain | Min. Shaman Level |
| :--------------: | :-------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
|        1         |       2nd       |        1st        |         3         |
|        2         |       4th       |        2nd        |         7         |
|        3         |       6th       |        3rd        |        11         |
|        4         |       8th       |        4th        |        15         |



### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain three feats of your choice, for which you qualify. You have to take the Ability Score Improvement feat at least once (two times is recommended).
You gain this feature again at Shaman levels 8, 12, and 16.



### Level 5: Elemental Specialization
The might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options depending on the role chosen at 1st level.

**Sage.**
- Add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage you deal with any Shaman cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater.
- Add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage you deal with each beam of your Fire Aspects Flaming Beam ability.
- Add half your Shaman level to the healing of your Water Aspects Healing Flow.
- For you, the die of the *[Resistance](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Resistance)* spell is now a d8 instead of a d4 and you add half your Shaman level to the amount of damage reduced.

**Warrior.**
- You add your Strength modifier to the damage of your melee attacks you make using your spellcasting ability modifier and vice versa your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage of your melee attacks you make using your Strength modifier.
- Once on each of your turns when you change the damage type of the weapon imbued by your *[Shillelagh](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Shillelagh)* spell to Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage, the damage die is doubled.
- Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a melee attack roll, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you hit).
- For you, the damage dice of the *[Absorb Elements](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Absorb%2520Elements)* spell are now d10s instead of d6s.



### Level 7: Elemental Manifestation
You gain the ability to physically manifest the elements from the Elemental Planes of existence. Depending on your chosen role, you have the following spell always prepared (it doesn't count against the number of your prepared spells):
- **Sage:** *[Summon Elemental](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Summon%2520Elemental)*
- **Warrior:** *[Conjure Minor Elementals](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Conjure%2520Minor%2520Elementals)*

**Action and Components.** You can cast the spell as an Action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction immediately after rolling initiative (in this case, your reaction doesn't recharge at the start of your first turn this combat). For this casting of the spell, it has neither a verbal, a somantic, nor a material cost.

**Ability instead of Casting.** Casting the spell doesn't count as casting or concentrating for such things as *Counterspell*, the Earth Aspects casting constraint, Barbarian Rage and so on. You still have to concentrate on it and have to make concentration checks as usual.

**Free Usage.** You can cast the spell once at 4th level without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can do so again. The level at which you cast the spell increases as you reach certain Shaman levels as described in the Free Elemental Manifestation Level table below.

##### Free Elemental Manifestation Level
| Shaman Level | Spell Level |
| :----------: | :---------: |
|      7       |     4th     |
|      10      |     5th     |
|      14      |     7th     |



### Level 14: Improved Aspect Call
You can expend two uses of Aspect Call at the same time to call forth two elemental aspects that will surround you.



### Level 15: Improved Elemental Specialization
The option you gained for your role for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below.

**Sage.**
- Add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage you deal with each ray of you Fire Aspects Flaming Rays ability.
- When you use your Water Aspects Healing Flow, it's range is now 30 feet for you and the dice you roll are d10s instead of d8s.
- For you, the die of the *[Resistance](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Resistance)* spell is now a d12 instead of a d4.

**Warrior.**
- When your *[Shillelagh](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Shillelagh)* damage die would be doubled, you instead triple it.
- The once per turn extra damage of your melee attack roll increases to 2d8.
- For you, the damage dice of the *[Absorb Elements](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/spells/Absorb%2520Elements)* spell are now d12s instead of d6s.



### Level 18: Genie Manifestation
When you cast your Elemental Manifestation spell using a spell slot of 9th level, you can transform your Elemental (**Sage**) or yourself (**Warrior**) into a genie - Djinni (air), Dao (earth), Efreeti (fire), or Marid (water). The Dungeon Master has the genie’s statistics.

#### Warrior Transformation Rules
- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the genie, but you retain your alignment, personality.
- When you transform, you assume the genie's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to O hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.
- You can't cast your spells, only the genie's.
- You keep your active Elemental Calls and can still use them.



### Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat or three other feats of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Energy Resistance is recommended.



### Level 20: Avatar of the Elements
You have ultimately mastered all four elements and can call them simultaneously to aid you in battle.
Expend four uses of Aspect Call at the same time to surround yourself with all four elemental aspects.
