### Level 1: Expertise
You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Sleight of Hand and Stealth are recommended if you have proficiency in them.
At Rogue level 6, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

### Level 1: Sneak Attack
You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same as the weapon's type.
You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack table.

##### Sneak Attack Damage
| Rogue Level | Sneak Attack |
| :---------: | :----------: |
|      1      |     1d6      |

### Level 1: Thieves' Cant
You picked up various languages in the communities where you plied your roguish talents. You know Thieves' Cant and one other language of your choice, which you choose from the [Language Tables](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/glossary/languages).
Alternatively, you can forgo knowing Thieves' Cant and pick up another language of your choice.


### Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties ([Weapon Overview](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/equipment/weapons)) of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Daggers and Shortbows.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Shortswords.

### Level 2: Cunning Action
Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action:
- **Dash.** Gain extra movement equal to your speed for the current turn.
- **Disengage.** Your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.
- **Hide.** Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to attempt to hide.
- **Sleight of Hand.** Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to pick a lock or disarm a trap with Thieves' Tools or to pick a pocket.
- **Use an Object.** Take the utilize action, or take the Magic action to use a magic item that requires that action.


### Level 2: Second-Story Work
You've trained to get into especially hard-to-reach places, granting you these benefits.
**Climber.** You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.
**Jumper.** You can determine your jump distance using your Dexterity rather than your Strength.


### Level 3: Rogue Subclass
You gain a Rogue subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Rogue levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Rogue level or lower.
- [Arcane Trickster](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/rogue/arcane_trickster)
- [Assassin](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/rogue/assassin)
- [Soulknife](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/classes/rogue/soulknife)


### Level 3: Steady Aim
As a Bonus Action, you give yourself Advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this feature only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.


### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain three feats of your choice, for which you qualify. You have to take the Ability Score Improvement feat at least once (two times is recommended).
You gain this feature again at Rogue levels 8, 10, 12, and 16.


### Level 5: Cunning Strike
You've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add
the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Distraction Pain effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack's damage before rolling.
If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.
- **Disarm (Cost: 1d6).** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it drops one item of your choice that it's holding.
- **Distracting Pain (Cost:1d6).** The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Stealth Attack (Cost: 1d6).** If you are hidden, this attack doesn't reveal your location if you end the turn behind Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover.
- **Trip (Cost: 1d6).** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.
- **Withdraw (Cost: 1d6).** Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.


### Level 5: Uncanny Dodge
When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.


### Level 6: Fast Assessment
As a Bonus Action, you can make a Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern whether a creature you are at least one round in combat with has any Immunities, Resistances, or Vulnerabilities, and what they are. For every round in combat, you gain a +1 bonus to the check.

### Level 7: Evasion
You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an *ice storm* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Level 7: Reliable Talent
Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike
You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost for each effect.

### Level 11: Additional Attunement
You've learned how to maximize use of magic items, you can attune to up to four magic items at once.

### Level 14: Devious Strikes
You've practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack deviously. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.
- **Daze (Cost:2d6).** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action.
- **Knock Out (Cost: 6d6).** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Obscure (Cost: 3d6).** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or it has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.

### Level 14: Blindsense
If you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

### Level 15: Slippery Mind
You have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.

### Level 15: Magic Device Expert
Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.

### Level 18: Elusive
You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll can have advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

### Level 18: Thief's Reflexes
You are adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal Initiative and your second turn at your Initiative minus 10.

### Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat or three other feats of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of the Night Spirit is recommended.

### Level 20: Stroke of Luck
You have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If you fail a D20 Test (Attack Roll, Ability Check, Saving Throw), you can turn the roll into a 20.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long rest.
