Hit Points represent durability and the will to live. Creatures with more Hit Points are more difficult to kill. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of Hit Points you have when uninjured. Your current Hit Points can be any number from that maximum down to 0, which is the lowest Hit Points can go.
Whenever you take damage, subtract it from your Hit Points. Hit Point loss has no effect on your capabilities until you reach 0 Hit Points. 
If you have half your Hit Points or fewer, you're Bloodied, which has no game effect on its own but which might trigger other game effects.

## Healing
Hit Points can be restored by magic, such as the *Cure Wounds* spell or a Potion of Healing, or by a Night or Long Rest (see the [Resting rules](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/adventuring/recovering/resting)).
When you receive healing, add the restored Hit Points to your current Hit Points. Your Hit Points can't exceed your Hit Point maximum, so any Hit Points regained in excess of the maximum are lost. For example, if you receive 8 Hit Points of healing and have 14 Hit Points and a Hit Point maximum of 20, you regain 6 Hit Points, not 8.


## Dropping to 0 Hit Points
When a creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it either dies outright or falls unconscious, as explained below.

### Instant Death
Here are the main ways a creature can die instantly.
**Monster Death.** A monster dies the instant it drops to 0 Hit Points, although a Dungeon Master can ignore this rule for an individual monster and treat it like a character.
**Hit Point Maximum of 0.** A creature dies if its Hit Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life energy, reducing a creature's Hit Point maximum.
**Massive Damage.** When damage reduces a character to 0 Hit Points and damage remains, the character dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their Hit Point maximum. For example, if your character has a Hit Point maximum of 12, currently has 6 Hit Points, and takes 18 damage, the character drops to 0 Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The character then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum.

### Character Demise
If your character dies, others might find a magical way to revive your character, such as with the *Raise Dead* spell. Or talk with the DM about making a new character to join the group. The rules glossary has more information on being dead.

### Falling Unconscious
If you reach 0 Hit Points and don't die instantly, you have the Unconscious condition (see the ["Conditions Overview"](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/glossary/condition_details)) until you regain any Hit Points, and you now face making Death Saving Throws (see below).

### Death Saving Throws
Whenever you start your turn with 0 Hit Points, you must make a Death Saving Throw to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to an ability score. You're in the hands of fate now.
**Three Successes/Failures.** Roll 1d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become Stable (see "Stabilizing a Character" below). On your third failure, you die.
The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any Hit Points or become Stable.
**Rolling a 1 or 20.** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for a Death Saving Throw, you suffer two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 Hit Point and automatically succeed on the Exhaustion Constitution Saving Throw (see below).
**Damage at 0 Hit Points.** If you take any damage while you have 0 Hit Points, you suffer a Death Saving Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.

### Gaining Exhaustion
If you are healed from 0 Hit Points, you may gain a level of [Exhaustion](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/general/damage_healing/exhaustion) in consequence of the straining experience. Make a Constitution Saving throw. The DC equals 12 plus 4 times the number of your failed Death Saves at the moment you were healed.

> Constitution Save DC = 12 + 4 * number of failed Death Saves

On a failure, you gain one level of exhaustion.
If you regain Hit Points from rolling a 20 on the d20 for a Death Saving Throw or from being stabilized, you automatically succeed on the save.

### Stabilizing a Character
You can take the Help action to try to stabilize a creature with 0 Hit Points, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. A Stable creature doesn't make Death Saving Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points, but it still has the Unconscious condition. If the creature takes damage, it stops being Stable and starts making Death Saving Throws again. A Stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours (it gains no exhaustion this way).

### Knocking Out a Creature
When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to 1 Hit Point and give it the Unconscious condition. It then starts a Short Rest, at the end of which that condition ends on it. The condition ends early if the creature regains any Hit Points or if someone takes an action to administer first aid to it, making a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.




## Temporary Hit Points
Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit Points, as explained below.

### Lose Temporary Hit Points First
If you have Temporary Hit Points and take damage, those points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your Hit Points. For example, if you have 5 Temporary Hit Points and take 7 damage, you lose those points and then lose 2 Hit Points.

### Duration
Temporary Hit Points last until they're depleted or you finish a Long Rest.

### They Don't Stack
Temporary Hit Points can't be added together. If you have Temporary Hit Points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 Temporary Hit Points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

### They're Not Hit Points or Healing
Temporary Hit Points can't be added to your Hit Points, healing can't restore them, and receiving Temporary Hit Points doesn't count as healing. Because Temporary Hit Points aren't Hit Points, a creature can be at full Hit Points and receive Temporary Hit Points.
If you have 0 Hit Points, receiving Temporary Hit Points doesn't restore you to consciousness. Only true healing can save you.
