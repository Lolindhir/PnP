Exploration involves delving into places that are dangerous and full of mystery. The rules in this section detail some of the ways adventurers interact with the environment in such places.



## Adventuring Equipment
As adventurers explore, their equipment can help them in many ways. For example, they can reach out-of-the-way places with a Ladder, perceive things they wouldn't otherwise notice with a Torch or another light source, bypass locked doors and containers with Thieves' Tools, and create obstacles for pursuers with Caltrops.

See the ["Equipment"](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/equipment) section for rules on many items that are useful on adventures. The items in ["Tools"](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/equipment/tools) and ["Adventuring Gear"](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/equipment/adventuring_gear) are especially useful. The weapons in that chapter can also be used for more than battle; you could use a Quarterstaff, for example, to push a sinister-looking button that you're reluctant to touch.



## Vision and Light
Some adventuring tasks—such as noticing danger, hitting an enemy, and targeting certain spells—are affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can hinder you, as explained below.



### Obscured Areas
An area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In a Lightly Obscured area—such as an area with Dim Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage—you have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
A Heavily Obscured area — such as an area with Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage — is opaque. You have the Blinded condition (see ["Conditions"](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/general/damage_healing/conditions) in the rules glossary) when trying to see something there.



### Light
The presence or absence of light determines the category of illumination in an area, as defined below.

**Bright Light.** Bright Light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.
**Dim Light.** Dim Light, also called shadows, creates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light is usually a boundary between Bright Light and surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might bathe the land in Dim Light.
**Darkness.** Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.

### Special Senses
Some creatures have special senses that help them perceive things in certain situations. The ["Vision & Light"](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/glossary/vision_light) section in the rules glossary defines the following special senses:
- Blindsight
- Darkvision
- Tremorsense
- Truesight



## Hiding
Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set an ambush. The Dungeon Master decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, you take the Hide action.



## Interacting with Objects
Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve. The player tells the DM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever or opening a door, and the DM describes what happens. Sometimes, however, rules govern what you can do with an object.

### What Is an Object?
For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone. It isn't a building or a vehicle, which are composed of many objects.

### Time-Limited Object Interactions
When time is short, such as in combat, interactions with objects are limited: one free interaction per turn. That interaction must occur during a creature's movement or action. Any additional interactions require the Utilize action, as explained in "Combat" later in this chapter.

### Finding Hidden Objects
When your character searches for hidden things, such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided you describe the character searching in the hidden object's vicinity. On a success, you find the object, other important details, or both.
If you describe your character searching nowhere near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check won't reveal the object, no matter the check's total.

### Carrying Objects
You can usually carry your gear and treasure without worrying about the weight of those objects. If you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the DM might require you to abide by the rules for carrying capacity in the ["Equipment" section](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/equipment).

### Breaking Objects
As an action, you can automatically break or otherwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such as a glass container or a piece of paper. If you try to damage something more resilient, the DM might use the [rules on breaking objects](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/glossary/objects_damage).



## Hazards
Monsters are the main perils characters face, but other dangers await. The ["Hazards"](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/glossary/hazards) section defines the following hazards:
- Burning
- Dehydration
- Falling
- Malnutrition
- Suffocation
