## Improvised Weapons
An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg, or a frying pan. A Simple or Martial weapon also counts as an improvised weapon if it's wielded in a way contrary to its design; if you use a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throw a Melee weapon that lacks the Thrown property, the weapon counts as an improvised weapon. An improvised weapon follows the rules below.
**Proficiency.** Don't add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls with an improvised weapon.
**Damage.** On a hit, the weapon deals 1d4 damage of a type the DM thinks is appropriate for the object.
**Range.** If you throw the weapon, it has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
**Weapon Equivalents.** If an improvised weapon resembles a Simple or Martial weapon, the DM may say it functions as that weapon and uses that weapon's rules. For example, the DM could treat a table leg as a Club.
