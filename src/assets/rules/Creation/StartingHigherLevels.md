Your DM might start your group's characters at a level higher than 1. It is particularly recommended to start at level 3 if your group is composed of seasoned D&D players.

### Creating Your Character
Creating a higher-level character uses the same character-creation steps outlined in ["Character Creation"](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/creation/character_creation) section and the rules for advancing beyond level 1 provided in the ["Level Up"](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/creation/leveling) section.


### Starting Equipment
Your character starts with more than the standard equipment for a level 1 character, even one or more consumable items. Consult the Starting Equipment by Level table for the starting money and the number and possible rarity of consumables. Also, check with your DM about what equipment is available for you to buy with your starting money and what free consumables you can get.
