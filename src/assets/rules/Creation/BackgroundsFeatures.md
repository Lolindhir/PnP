### Additional Connection
You gain an additional connection from the [Background Connection list](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/creation/character_creation/backgrounds/backgrounds_connections). If choosing the Faction Member connection, you can select a major faction instead of a minor one.


### Bounty Hunter
You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people and places of the local area. 


### False Identity
You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. You gain one connection from the [Background Connection list](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/creation/character_creation/backgrounds/backgrounds_connections). There is a risk of blowing your false identity involved, determined by your DM.
During a sufficient downtime, you can create another false identity. With every created false identity, the risk of blowing one of them increases.


### From Money
Your past has granted you access to wealth, whether through your own endeavors, inheritance, or family connections. You have lived a life of comfort and luxury, and you are accustomed to the finer things in life. This background feature allows you to start your adventuring career with ten times the usual starting wealth, reflecting the resources and financial support you have at your disposal.


### Honed Role
You have honed your skills in a chosen field to a professional level. When you spend your downtime performing this role (such as playing music, competing in athletic events, finding mercenary work, or crafting items), you can maintain a comfortable lifestyle for yourself and your party, provided there are opportunities to perform your role in the area.


### Master of Caravans
Your extensive experience with vehicles and caravans has made you a master of handling and managing them. You have advantage on all ability checks related to operating, steering, and maintaining vehicles, as well as organizing and leading caravans. Whether it's navigating through treacherous terrain or ensuring the safety and efficiency of your caravan, your skills ensure that your journey remains smooth and successful.


### Master of the Seas
Your extensive experience on the open seas has made you a master of handling ships and navigating treacherous waters. You have advantage on all ability checks related to operating, steering, and maintaining ships, as well as navigating through hazardous maritime conditions. Whether it's a stormy night or a narrow strait, your skills ensure that your vessel and crew remain safe and on course.


### Researcher
When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. While researching in downtime, you have advantage on all ability checks regarding your research and your progress on that research is doubled.


### Wanderer
You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you.
In addition, you are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an ability check related to your favored terrain, you have advantage on that role. When you forage in your favored terrain, you find twice as much food and water as you normally would. If justified, you can gain additional favored terrain types during your travel through the world.
