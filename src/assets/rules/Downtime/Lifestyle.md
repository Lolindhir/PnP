## Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment maintenance, and other necessities.
At the start of each week or month (DM's choice) during a Downtime Period, choose a lifestyle below — Wretched, Squalid, Poor, Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic — and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.
Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the DM might take them into account when determining risks or how others perceive your character.

### Lifestyles

##### Wretched (Free)
You survive by chance and charity. You are often exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping outside.

##### Squalid (1 SP per Day)
You spend the bare minimum for your necessities. You might be exposed to unhealthy conditions and opportunistic criminals.

##### Poor (2 SP per Day)
You spend frugally for your necessities.

##### Modest (1 GP per Day)
You support yourself at an average level.

##### Comfortable (2 GP per Day)
You spend modestly for your necessities and enjoy a few luxuries.

##### Wealthy (4 GP per Day)
You are accustomed to the finer things in life and might have servants.

##### Aristocratic (10 GP per Day)
You pay for the best and might have a staff that supports your lifestyle. Others notice your wealth and might encourage you to share it, either legally or otherwise.


## Bonuses

Depending on the duration spent in a certain lifestyle during your Downtime Period, you gain more or fewer lingering bonuses for a certain time (see table below). The standard lifestyle is Modest. If you rest in a lifestyle above Modest, you gain additional bonuses as described in the [Resting section](https://lolindhir.github.io/PnP/rules/adventuring/recovering/resting).

## Penalties

If you live a lifestyle below Modest, the minimum duration of a Downtime Period is extended (Poor = 4 days, Squalid = 5 days, Wretched = 7 days), and at the DM's discretion, it may take longer or be more difficult to fully recover all your resources.
