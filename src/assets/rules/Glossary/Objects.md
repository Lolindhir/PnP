Objects can be harmed by attacks and by some spells, using the rules below. If an object is exceedingly fragile, the DM may allow a creature to break it automatically with the Attack or Utilize action.
**Armor Class.** The Object Armor Class table suggests ACs for various substances.

##### Object Armor Class
| AC  | Substance           |
| :-: | :------------------ |
| 11  | Cloth, paper, rope  |
| 13  | Crystal, glass, ice |
| 15  | Wood                |
| 17  | Stone               |
| 19  | Iron, steel         |
| 21  | Mithral             |
| 23  | Adamantine          |

**Hit Points.** An object is destroyed when it has 0 Hit Points. The Object Hit Points table suggests Hit Points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller. To track Hit Points for a Huge or Gargantuan object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's Hit Points separately. The DM determines whether destroying part of an object causes the whole thing to collapse.

##### Object Hit Points
| Size                        | Fragile  | Resilient |
| :-------------------------- | :------- | :-------- |
| Tiny (bottle, lock)         | 2 (1d4)  | 5 (2d4)   |
| Small (chest, lute)         | 3 (1d6)  | 10 (3d6)  |
| Medium (barrel, chandelier) | 4 (1d8)  | 18 (4d8)  |
| Large (cart, dining table)  | 5 (1d10) | 27 (5d10) |

**Damage Types and Objects.** Objects have Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. The DM might decide that some damage types are more or less effective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have Vulnerability to Fire damage.

**Damage Threshold.** Big objects, such as castle walls, often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. 
An object that has a damage threshold has Immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes that entire instance of damage. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the damage threshold is superficial and doesn't reduce Hit Points.
For example, if an object has a damage threshold of 10, the object takes no damage if 9 damage is dealt to it, since that damage fails to exceed the threshold. If the same object is dealt 11 damage, it takes all of that damage.

**No Ability Scores.** An object lacks ability scores unless a rule assigns scores to the object. Without ability scores, an object can't make ability checks, and it fails all saving throws.
